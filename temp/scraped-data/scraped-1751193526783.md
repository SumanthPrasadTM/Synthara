## Continuing Education Activity

Sonographic evaluation of the amniotic fluid index (AFI) is a standardized and noninvasive method used during pregnancy to assess amniotic fluid volume, which is critical for fetal development and well-being. Amniotic fluid provides a protective environment, facilitates movement, supports temperature regulation, and contributes to the development of fetal organs such as the lungs. Additionally, the volume of amniotic fluid, produced and processed primarily by the fetus, reflects placental function. Measuring the AFI involves dividing the uterus into 4 quadrants and measuring the deepest vertical pocket of fluid in each quadrant, with these measurements combined to calculate the total AFI. A normal AFI ranges from 5 to 24 cm in singleton pregnancies, with deviations indicating oligohydramnios (low fluid) or polyhydramnios (excess fluid). An alternative evaluation method is the maximal vertical pocket (MVP) measurement, which is particularly useful in cases of multiple gestations or when AFI results are unclear.

Oligohydramnios, often caused by placental insufficiency or membrane rupture, can lead to complications such as pulmonary hypoplasia, fetal distress, and increased perinatal morbidity. Conversely, polyhydramnios, associated with conditions like maternal diabetes or fetal swallowing impairments, may result in preterm labor, macrosomia, or respiratory discomfort for the mother. Regular sonographic evaluation of amniotic fluid is integral to monitoring high-risk pregnancies, guiding clinical interventions, and ensuring optimal outcomes for both mother and fetus. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in appropriately performing sonographic techniques to evaluate amniotic fluid volume, interpreting evaluation findings, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional management approach to improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**

- Identify indications for sonographic evaluation of amniotic fluid volume.

- Apply appropriate ultrasound techniques to measure amniotic fluid volume.

- Implement applicable management approaches in a patient with various amniotic fluid parameters.

- Apply interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes in patients who undergo amniotic fluid evaluation.

## Introduction

Amniotic fluid is critical during pregnancy to provide a protective and nourishing environment for the developing fetus. It maintains a sterile space, regulates temperature, and cushions against external shocks. Amniotic fluid facilitates fetal movement, essential for musculoskeletal development, and supports the growth of organs, primarily the lungs. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[2\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The amount of amniotic fluid gradually increases until approximately 34 weeks gestation, after which it slightly decreases until 40 weeks and then declines more sharply after 42 weeks. [\[3\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

In the early stages of pregnancy, the composition of amniotic fluid resembles a complex dialysate derived from maternal serum. As the fetus grows, changes occur in the fluid's composition; notably, sodium concentration and osmolality decrease while urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels increase. [\[4\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[5\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Amniotic fluid also contains various steroid and protein hormones. [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[7\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Initially, it has little to no particulate matter, but by 16 weeks gestation, a significant number of cells shed from the amnion, skin, and tracheobronchial tree are present. These cells are crucial for antenatal diagnosis and serve as a source of DNA for karyotype analysis following amniocentesis. [\[8\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Typically, fetuses do not defecate during pregnancy; however, if under severe stress, they may pass meconium. This material contains bile pigments that can stain the amniotic fluid green, indicating fetal stress. [\[9\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The regulation of amniotic fluid volume (AFV) involves 3 primary mechanisms: placental control of water and solute transfer, fetal contributions through urine production and swallowing, and maternal factors affecting fluid balance.

Before 16 weeks of gestation, amniotic fluid is maintained primarily through intramembranous flow, transitioning to fetal urine production as the kidneys mature. The evaluation of amniotic fluid can be an indicator of fetal well-being. [\[10\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Maternal and placental factors, including serum osmolality, blood pressure, and placental vascularity, also influence AFV by modulating intramembranous flow. Conditions like maternal dehydration or altered placental function can disrupt this balance, leading to changes in amniotic fluid levels.

Clinical assessment of AF is essential to detect oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios, which can signal underlying fetal or maternal conditions. Ultrasound offers a rapid, noninvasive way to evaluate amniotic fluid. Some studies have noted that sonographic assessment of amniotic fluid may not be accurate compared to the more direct dye dilution method, as ultrasound measurements are less accurate in evaluating abnormal amniotic fluid volumes than normal volumes. [\[11\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) However, ultrasound offers a safe real-time option with comparable clinical outcomes. [\[13\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[14\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Sonographic assessment can be qualitative, visually assessing the volume ratio of amniotic fluid to the fetus and placenta, or semiquantitative. The 2 main methods for semiquantitative evaluation are the deepest vertical pocket (DVP) and the amniotic fluid index (AFI). Current guidelines recommend using DVP to diagnose oligohydramnios and AFI for polyhydramnios in singleton pregnancies, as studies indicate that these methods reduce the risk of overdiagnosis. For twin pregnancies, DVP is measured separately for each sac. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Therefore, a thorough understanding of amniotic fluid production, regulation, and assessment is crucial for optimizing maternal-fetal care, as abnormalities in AFV can have significant implications for perinatal outcomes.

## Anatomy and Physiology

**Amniotic fluid Physiology**

At the beginning of pregnancy, amniotic fluid is primarily a byproduct of maternal serum and resembles plasma due to hydrostatic and osmotic pressures. After 8 weeks of gestation, the fetal kidneys begin to function and produce urine; however, this does not become a key component of amniotic fluid until closer to 23 to 25 weeks, when fetal keratinization is complete. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) By the time keratinization is complete, fetal urinary production accounts for the most significant amount of amitotic fluid, with up to 1500 mL produced daily. [\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) In the last 20 weeks, fetal respiratory and gastric secretions also contribute up to 350 mL per day. Amniotic fluid is recycled primarily by fetal swallowing. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Additional recycling pathways include the intramembranous pathway of the placenta, umbilical cord, and fetal skin between the amniotic fluid and fetal blood (400 mL per day). [\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Amniotic fluid increases at a linear rate initially in the first half of pregnancy and continues to increase until the 36th or 38th week of pregnancy with an average maximal volume of 800 mL. [\[10\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Next, amniotic fluid can decrease by 8% per week, down to as low as 400 mL in gestation, near week 42. [\[10\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Under normal conditions, maternal serum remains near but slightly lower in osmolality to fetal serum, favoring flow to the fetus. Following fetal keratinization, amniotic fluid remains 10 Osm lower than fetal blood, allowing continuous flow through the placenta to the fetal blood. [\[10\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) In maternal dehydration, this balanced gradient between maternal and fetal serum can reverse, favoring flow out of the fetal circulation. Counter-regulation by continued flow into fetal circulation can decrease amniotic fluid volume when this occurs. These osmolarity gradient changes may explain why maternal hydration effectively reduces isolated uncomplicated oligohydramnios and why hyperglycemia often results in polyhydramnios. [\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The fetus can also affect the flow through these pathways due to the excretion of certain hormones, like growth factors and prolactin, which can alter membranes' permeability.

**Oligohydramnios**

Decreased fetal urine output can arise from several causes, which fall into 2 general categories—fetal urinary tract obstruction and decreased urine production by the fetal kidney. [\[16\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The inability to visualize any amniotic fluid is termed anhydramnios. Urinary tract obstruction can occur anywhere along the fetal urinary tract and can be catastrophic for the fetus. Decreased urine production by the fetal kidney typically reflects inadequate blood flow to the fetal kidney, caused by the shunting of fetal blood flow away from the kidney to the heart and brain. When the fetus receives insufficient nutrients and oxygen from the placenta, blood is redirected away from the fetal kidney, decreasing the glomerular filtration rate and reducing urinary output. Therefore, decreased amniotic fluid volume due to decreased urine production by the fetal kidney is a reflection of chronic hypoperfusion of the fetus. [\[17\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[18\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) This mechanism mirrors the cause of oliguria in critically ill adults. [\[19\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[20\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Another common cause of oligohydramnios is the rupture of the amniotic membrane, which allows amniotic fluid to leak out of the uterus. [\[21\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[22\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) can occur spontaneously or as a result of medical procedures (eg, amniocentesis). When PPROM occurs after 25 weeks, survival outcomes are more favorable, improving as gestational age advances, as the fetus has more time for normal lung development. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

**Polyhydramnios**

Polyhydramnios, or increased amniotic fluid volume, also has several potential causes, with 2 primary mechanisms—decreased fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid or increased fetal production of amniotic fluid. [\[23\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Polyhydramnios can cause overdistension of the gravid uterus, especially in cases where the fetus is normal size or large for dates. This overdistension increases the patient's risk for preterm contractions, preterm delivery, and premature rupture of membranes, in which the patient's water breaks before the onset of labor. Overdistension of the uterus is also a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage after delivery. [\[24\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[25\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

The normal fetus constantly swallows amniotic fluid and urinates to maintain the fluid level. If the fetus is unable to swallow the typical amounts of amniotic fluid, it can lead to polyhydramnios. This condition can occur due to gastrointestinal malformations, fetal neurological issues, eg, anencephaly, or mechanical obstruction of the esophagus by other intrathoracic processes. [\[23\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Increased production of amniotic fluid can occur due to fetal polyuria, often observed in cases of uncontrolled maternal diabetes with persistently elevated maternal blood sugar levels. In these cases, it may be associated with fetal macrosomia. Many cases of polyhydramnios are idiopathic, meaning no definite cause is identified. [\[26\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Indications

Amniotic fluid assessments are considered integral to the routine anatomic fetal evaluation, with derangements often found incidentally. Several professional society guidelines state that amniotic fluid assessment should be performed at all sonographic fetal evaluations. [\[27\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[18\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[27\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Specific high-risk factors in pregnancies have the potential to alter amniotic fluid dynamics and may warrant serial assessments. These high-risk factors include hypertension severe enough to require antihypertensives, pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders, fetal growth restriction, certain fetal anatomic anomalies, and late-term pregnancies. Additionally, when fundal size on a routine exam does not correlate with the gestational size, the amniotic fluid volume should be assessed. [\[28\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The assessment of amniotic fluid volume can also help rule out rupture of membranes and is included in the general assessment of fetal wellbeing as 1 of the 5 parts of the biophysical profile.

## Contraindications

Although diagnostic ultrasound is generally considered safe in pregnancy, ultrasound should only be performed when medically indicated. The concept of as-low-as-reasonably-achievable should be applied to reduce the overall thermal index exposed to the fetus. [\[29\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Doppler should not be used unless necessary due to the high-energy output of this technique. [\[30\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Equipment

Performing a diagnostics ultrasound in pregnancy requires real-time scanning. For subjective fluid measurement in the first trimester of pregnancy, intracavitary transducers may be used. Most amniotic fluid assessments will occur in the second and third trimester and utilize a transabdominal approach with a curvilinear transducer able to provide greater than 3 MHz. [\[29\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Technique or Treatment

**Amniotic Fluid Volume Assessment Techniques**

To assess amniotic fluid using sonography, the patient should be positioned supine, with the transducer held perpendicular to the floor, and aligned coronally to the patient. For the DVP, also referred to as the maximum vertical pocket (MVP), the entire uterus is scanned to identify the amniotic fluid pocket with the greatest vertical length. This pocket, which appears hypoechoic on ultrasound, is measured using vertical sonographic calipers. [\[31\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The measurement process must ensure that the calipers do not cross over fetal body parts or portions of the umbilical cord, as this could overestimate the pocket size. Pockets must be at least 1 cm wide to be considered valid, except for biophysical profiles, where a 2 cm width is required. [\[32\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[32\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

To calculate the AFI, the uterus is divided into 4 quadrants using the umbilicus as the central point. To ensure measurement consistency, the transducer should remain in an axial plane (notch toward the patient’s right). Each quadrant is systematically scanned to identify the largest vertical pocket of fluid, which is then measured with vertical calipers. The 4 measurements are added together to determine the total AFI. [\[33\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Color Doppler is recommended to confirm that the measured pockets are free of umbilical cord segments, which may not be visible on standard B-mode imaging. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[18\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[34\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

A DVP measurement is used for pregnancies <24 weeks or those with multiple gestations. [\[35\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The procedure is similar to that for AFI, but only a single DVP is identified and measured. A normal DVP ranges from 2 to 8 cm, with values <2 cm indicating oligohydramnios and >8 cm indicating polyhydramnios. [\[36\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[37\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Amniotic fluid measurements can vary due to intra-observer differences, maternal position, and hydration status. Maternal hydration, especially with simple hypotonic oral solutions, can improve the specificity of oligohydramnios diagnosis. [\[27\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[38\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Therefore, encouraging the patient to consume several liters of water before the evaluation may enhance accuracy. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[39\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

**Biophysical Profile**

Amniotic fluid volume is an essential component of the fetal biophysical profile, a specialized ultrasound technique used to assess fetal well-being. The biophysical profile has 4 sonographic components, each of which must be observed within 30 minutes of starting the ultrasound:

- Fetal breathing: Continuous movement of the fetal diaphragm for at least 30 seconds)

- Fetal movement: At least 3 discrete movements of the fetal body or limbs)

- Fetal tone: At least 1 active extension of a fetal limb with the return to flexion or opening and closing of the fetal hand

- Amniotic fluid volume: A single deepest pocket of at least 2 cm [\[40\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[41\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)


A fetal nonstress test measuring fetal heart rate tracing is also performed with the biophysical profile for a total of 5 components. [\[42\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

A healthy, term fetus that is not under physiological stress is expected to demonstrate all 4 of these behaviors on ultrasound. Preterm fetuses may not display all of these behaviors. Therefore, the management of pregnancies in which the fetus does not show all 4 behaviors described depends on the gestational age and the specific factors that are abnormal. [\[43\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Complications

Complications during the sonographic assessment of AFI or DVP are minimal. When performing the ultrasound, patients may experience discomfort with the pressure from the ultrasound probe or lightheadedness from the gravid uterus's compression on the vena cava in the supine position. A rolled towel under the patient’s flank to provide left lateral tilt may improve venous return and improve symptoms. [\[44\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Clinical Significance

**Interpretation of Abnormal Amniotic Fluid Measurements**

Normal reference ranges for the AFI vary depending on if the 5 to 95 or 3 to 97 percentiles are applied. For single gestations above 20 weeks, normal fluid is noted as an AFI between 5 to 24 cm, although some references prefer 25 cm as the upper limit. MVP in single-gestation pregnancies is considered normal when measured between 2 and 8 cm. It is important to note that only MVP is used to assess the amniotic fluid volumes in multi-gestation pregnancies. In a diamniotic pregnancy, the MVP is measured in each amniotic sac, allowing the clinician to attribute fluid to each fetus. Although the normal range for twins is closer to 2.2 to 7.5 cm, it is conventionally defined as between 2 to 8 cm. [\[31\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[45\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Oligohydramnios is diagnosed when amniotic fluid values fall below normal cut-offs. The list of potential causes is long and includes any condition causing uteroplacental insufficiency, anatomic issues with fetal urine production, and urinary tract obstructions. In severe cases, early pulmonary hypoplasia and limb disfigurement occur, resulting in significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. Even among structurally normal fetuses, oligohydramnios' mortality has been shown to have a 50-fold increase compared to a fetus with normal amniotic fluid measurements. [\[46\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Patients with oligohydramnios have several additional complications, including higher rates of intrauterine growth restriction, fetal distress on heart rate monitoring, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, low Apgar scores, and higher rates of cesarean section. [\[46\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[47\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[48\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[49\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

**Management of Abnormal Amniotic Fluid Volumes**

As a result of these complications, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends induction of pregnancy for isolated oligohydramnios between 36.0 and 37.6 weeks. [\[50\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Measurements must be obtained accurately, as these can lead to unnecessary intervention. Multiple studies have compared the use of the AFI with MVP for the diagnosis of oligohydramnios. Results indicate that AFI, compared to MVP, tends to overestimate clinically significant oligohydramnios and leads to overdiagnosis without improving maternal and perinatal outcomes. [\[35\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[51\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Therefore, MVP is the preferred method for diagnosing oligohydramnios. [\[31\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Polyhydramnios results from conditions in which there is increased production of amniotic fluid or decreased fetal swallowing. Causes of overproduction can include increased osmotic forces (eg, hyperglycemia or hydrops), cardiac dysfunction, infection leading to decreased fetal swallowing (occurs due to gastrointestinal tract obstruction), impaired neurological swallowing pathways, and some cranial facial abnormalities. The majority of cases are mild with no underlying etiology. As the severity of polyhydramnios increases, so does the incidence of fetal structural and genetic anomalies. Polyhydramnios can be graded in severity using the following thresholds for AFI or DVP:

- AFI


- Mild 24 to 29.9 cm

- Moderate 30 to 34.9 cm

- Severe ≥35 cm


- DVP


- Mild 8 to 11 cm

- Moderate 12 to 15 cm

- Severe: >16 cm [\[28\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)


Some evidence suggests that the MVP method may overestimate polyhydramnios, but more data is needed to confirm this hypothesis. [\[38\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Polyhydramnios has been shown to increase perinatal mortality to a lesser extent than oligohydramnios, with the rate dependent on the underlying cause. Perinatal morbidity associated with polyhydramnios includes an increase in preterm labor, macrosomia, nonvertex positions, nonreassuring fetal heart tracings, and cesarean delivery. [\[48\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Polyhydramnios can cause significant discomfort to the mother as severe cases can impair adequate maternal respiration. In these cases, therapeutic amnioreduction may be considered. For most causes of mild polyhydramnios, ACOG currently recommends delivery between 39 and 39.6 weeks. [\[50\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

**Abnormal Amniotic Fluid Management in Multiple Gestations**

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome is a special case that warrants mentioning in the discussion of amniotic fluid derangement due to its simultaneous presentation of both polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios during the same pregnancy. This syndrome occurs in 10% to 15% of diamniotic-monochorionic twins due to shared chorionic vessels. [\[52\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The diagnosis requires a single placenta and the findings of oligohydramnios in 1 twin and polyhydramnios in the other. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome is often associated with hydrops of the twin with polyhydramnios and growth restriction of the twin with oligohydramnios. Due to significant associated maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity, current guidelines recommend screening starting at 16 weeks and continuing every 2 weeks until delivery to allow for early identification and treatment to guide delivery timelines.

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The assessment and management of amniotic fluid levels, including oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios, require a coordinated interprofessional approach to ensure optimal patient-centered care, safety, and outcomes. These conditions, which can have profound implications during pregnancy, demand heightened vigilance from healthcare team members. Physicians, including obstetricians, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and pediatric radiologists, play a pivotal role in performing and interpreting detailed anatomic ultrasounds to detect fetal anomalies commonly associated with abnormal amniotic fluid levels. Advanced practitioners, eg, nurse practitioners, must also be proficient in understanding and assessing the amniotic fluid index as part of the biophysical profile to monitor fetal well-being and identify potential complications.

Effective care requires robust interprofessional communication and collaboration. When abnormalities in amniotic fluid are suspected, referrals to obstetricians or maternal-fetal medicine specialists for advanced imaging and evaluation are critical. In cases of severe oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios, care coordination must include neonatal clinicians and personnel skilled in neonatal resuscitation, eg, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) trained nurses and specialized physicians, to manage potential complications during delivery. Delivery in a tertiary care facility is often necessary due to the higher likelihood of NICU admissions and postnatal anomalies.

The healthcare team’s responsibilities include ensuring patient safety and optimizing outcomes through comprehensive care coordination. This involves timely identification of at-risk pregnancies, appropriate referrals, and interdisciplinary discussions to develop individualized care plans. By fostering a team-based approach that integrates the expertise of physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, and other health professionals, the healthcare system can effectively address the complexities of amniotic fluid abnormalities. This collaboration enhances team performance and ensures that maternal and neonatal outcomes are prioritized throughout the continuum of care.

## Abstract

**Objective:**

The relationship between amniotic fluid volume and gestational age has been described previously. The association of body weight and urine output has been observed in human neonates. Our goal was to assess the correlation of the amniotic fluid index (AFI) with estimated fetal weight (EFW) in the third trimester.


**Methods:**

We conducted a retrospective observational study on 426 pregnant women with singleton gestations who were referred to our unit for sonographic evaluation in the third trimester. The AFI, EFW, and EFW percentile corrected for gestational age were evaluated. The sonographic examinations were stratified into 3 gestational age categories: 28 through 33.9 weeks, 34 through 37.9 weeks, and 38 weeks and later. Maternal and fetal outcome variables were collected from medical records. Linear regression, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis.


**Results:**

There was no significant relationship between the AFI and EFW in the entire group of patients (R = 0.08; P = .096). There was a significant relationship between the AFI and EFW after 38 weeks' gestation (R = 0.30; P = .003). In addition, in female fetuses the EFW percentile correlated with higher AFI values at all gestational ages (R = 0.31; P < .001); this, however, was not observed in male fetuses.


**Conclusions:**

There is no relationship between the AFI and EFW during the third trimester, although a positive relationship between the AFI and EFW was noted late in gestation. In pregnancies with female fetuses, the AFI was positively associated with EFW percentile before 38 weeks' gestation.

## Abstract

We aimed to study the association between three different methods of assessing the amount of amniotic fluid (subjective method (SM), deepest vertical pocket (DVP) and amniotic fluid index (AFI)) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) (in percentile or Z-score) after adjustment on maternal-fetal parameters. We performed a nationwide cross-sectional study through the French network of obstetric sonographers using the “flash” study method and including low-risk singleton pregnancies from 18–40 weeks. Crude and adjusted odds ratio were computed after stratification upon 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. 1667 ultrasound scans performed by 65 operators were included. Only Z-score of EFW was significantly associated with SM in both trimesters. For DVP and AFI, Z-score of EFW and male fetal gender was significantly associated with them in 2nd trimester. In the 3rd trimester, both Z-score of EFW and large (LGA) or small for gestational age (SGA) fetus were significantly associated with AFI. and DVP. Overweight woman and class I obesity women were also significantly associated with DVP modification. In conclusion, all three methods of amniotic fluid evaluation are significantly associated to estimated fetal weight. DVP and AFI appeared equivalent except that maternal-fetal factors seemed to have a higher impact in DVP than AFI.

## Introduction

The evaluation of amniotic fluid during a routine ultrasound scan can be performed in three ways: the subjective way, the measurement of the single deepest vertical pocket, or the evaluation of amniotic fluid index. The subjective method consists of visually estimating the amniotic fluid pockets during an ultrasound scan. The accuracy of this assessment will rely strongly on the experience of the sonographer[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR1 "Halperin, M. E., Fong, K. W., Zalev, A. H. & Goldsmith, C. H. Reliability of amniotic fluid volume estimation from ultrasonograms: intraobserver and interobserver variation before and after the establishment of criteria. Am J Obstet Gynecol 153, 264–267 (1985)."). The deepest vertical pocket evaluation consists of measuring the largest pocket free of fetal structures or cord with the ultrasound probe positioned parallel to sagittal plane[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR2 "Chamberlain, P. F., Manning, F. A., Morrison, I., Harman, C. R. & Lange, I. R. Ultrasound evaluation of amniotic fluid volume. I. The relationship of marginal and decreased amniotic fluid volumes to perinatal outcome. Am J Obstet Gynecol 150, 245–249 (1984)."), [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR3 "Chamberlain, P. F., Manning, F. A., Morrison, I., Harman, C. R. & Lange, I. R. Ultrasound evaluation of amniotic fluid volume. II. The relationship of increased amniotic fluid volume to perinatal outcome. Am J Obstet Gynecol 150, 250–254 (1984)."). The amniotic fluid index is the sum of the four largest vertical pockets of amniotic fluid, measured in each of the 4 uterus quadrants defined relative to the umbilicus[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR4 "Phelan, J. P., Ahn, M. O., Smith, C. V., Rutherford, S. E. & Anderson, E. Amniotic fluid index measurements during pregnancy. J Reprod Med 32, 601–604 (1987)."), [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR5 "Phelan, J. P., Smith, C. V., Broussard, P. & Small, M. Amniotic fluid volume assessment with the four-quadrant technique at 36–42 weeks’ gestation. J Reprod Med 32, 540–542 (1987)."). Several studies have reported that the amniotic fluid index was dependent on gestational age[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR6 "Moore, T. R. & Cayle, J. E. The amniotic fluid index in normal human pregnancy. Am J Obstet Gynecol 162, 1168–1173 (1990)."), [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR7 "Nwosu, E. C., Welch, C. R., Manasse, P. R. & Walkinshaw, S. A. Longitudinal assessment of amniotic fluid index. Br J Obstet Gynaecol 100, 816–819 (1993)."). Even though none of these methods is really satisfactory, discovering an abnormal amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy may change the perinatal care. In fact, finding a decrease amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy might be due to either a pathological situation such as preterm premature rupture of membranes or a malformation/dysfunction of the fetal urination, or might also be physiological, but needing ultrasound survey of the evolution.

Intuitively, many sonographers interpret the amount of amniotic fluid based on the estimation of fetal weight performed at the same time. It seems reassuring to have a more abundant amniotic fluid when the fetus has a greater weight. Indeed, fetal renal perfusion increases when increasing fetal weight[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR8 "Gilbert, W. M., Moore, T. R. & Brace, R. A. Amniotic fluid volume dynamics. Fet Med Rev. 3, 89–104 (1991)."). Therefore, we can assume that there might be a correlation or an association between fetal weight estimation and the quantity of amniotic fluid. Such an association could indicate that the amniotic fluid assessment should consider the fetal parameters to make it more precise. A review of the existing literature showed conflicting results on the possible correlation between the amount of amniotic fluid and fetal weight estimation[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR9 "Adeyekun, A.

However, these studies were all unicentric, based only on a small number of patients (from 90 to 400 patients), mainly retrospective and did not analyze the influence of other factors. Ultrasound scans were only performed during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and did not assess the single deepest vertical pocket method even though it has been demonstrated that this method was more reliable than the amniotic fluid index that would result in an increase in the false positive rate for a diagnosis of oligohydramnios[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR10 "Meyer, W. J. et al. Effect of amniotic fluid volume on ultrasonic fetal weight estimation. J Ultrasound Med 14, 193–197 (1995)."), [13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR13 "Magann, E. F., Chauhan, S. P., Doherty, D. A., Magann, M. I. & Morrison, J. C. The evidence for abandoning the amniotic fluid index in favor of the single deepest pocket.

Besides fetal parameters, maternal characteristics such as maternal age or body mass index may also influence the amount of amniotic fluid.

Given the aforementioned considerations, the objective of our study is to determine if there is an association between the different methods of assessing the amniotic fluid and the estimated fetal weight in crude and after adjustment on maternal or fetal characteristics.

## Material and Methods

### Study design

This study is a national prospective, multicentric, observational study, performed under the methodology of “Flash” studies[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR15 "Kuleva, M. et al. A standardized approach for the assessment of the lower uterine segment at first trimester by transvaginal ultrasound: a flash study.

Flash studies are pragmatic, short and very focused studies conducted without modifying the routine clinical practice. They are conducted over the countrywide network of sonographers who are members of the French College of Fetal Ultrasound (CFEF - College Français d’Echographie Foetale). We invited sonographers first to take an online training course ( [www.cfef.org](http://www.cfef.org/)) reviewing the aims of the study, the inclusion criteria and the methodology. Only sonographers who completed the course and passed the final test were eligible to participate in the study. From February 2nd 2016 to February 15th 2016, sonographers were asked to assess during their routine ultrasound scan the amount of amniotic fluid according to the three methods (subjective/single deepest vertical pocket/amniotic fluid index). After receiving patient approval, the sonographer accessed, through his/her personal login codes, to a patient’s individual electronic file report on the CFEF website, dedicated to the study, and with which he/she fulfilled patient data. Each pregnant woman contributed to the study with a single ultrasound scan and was prospectively and consecutively included over time. Pregnancy dating was based on the crown-rump length measurement in the first trimester, as recommended by the French College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (CNGOF)[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR18 "Papageorghiou, A. T. et al. International standards for early fetal size and pregnancy dating based on ultrasound measurement of crown-rump length in the first trimester of pregnancy.

### Population

Inclusion criteria were: women over 18 years, carrying a singleton pregnancy without congenital malformation at a gestational age from 18 weeks to 40 weeks of gestation, with an uncomplicated pregnancy and who consent to participate in the study. Non-inclusion criteria were the existence of a pregnancy complication listed below: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (which includes gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and eclampsia), gestational diabetes, stillbirth, cholestasis and threatened preterm labor. Gestational hypertension was defined by a systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher on two separate occasions after 20 weeks of gestation in the absence of proteinuria. Preeclampsia was defined as gestational hypertension with either proteinuria 300 mg or more in a 24-hour sample or, if a 24-hour sample was not available, 2+ or higher on dipstick testing, or a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of 0.03 g/mmol or more.[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR20 "Al, R.

Gestational diabetes was defined by one abnormal value on the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test according to thresholds from the HAPO study (fasting ≥ 5.1 mmol/l, 1 hour ≥ 10.0 mmol/l, 2 hours ≥ 8.5 mmol/l)[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR23 "College.national.des.gynecologues.et.obstetriciens.francais. Gestational diabetes. J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris) 39, S139, S338–142 (2010)."). Cholestasis was defined as symptoms of pruritus that typically include the palms and soles, as well as elevated bile acid levels[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR24 "Williamson, C. & Geenes, V.

Estimated fetal weight (EFW) was obtained with the 4 parameters Hadlock formula[28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR28 "Hadlock, F. P., Harrist, R. B., Sharman, R. S., Deter, R. L. & Park, S. K. Estimation of fetal weight with the use of head, body, and femur measurements–a prospective study. Am J Obstet Gynecol 151, 333–337 (1985).") and EFW percentile was derived by using Hadlock reference charts[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR29 "Hadlock, F. P., Harrist, R. B. & Martinez-Poyer, J. In utero analysis of fetal growth: a sonographic weight standard.

Regarding amniotic fluid evaluation, the sonographer began with the subjective method (SM) consisting in visually estimate the amniotic fluid pockets during the ultrasound scan. We asked the sonographer to report and classify the findings it in three way: oligohydramnios, normal, polyhydramnios. Then, deepest vertical pocket (DVP) evaluation was performed, consisting in measuring vertically the largest pocket free of fetal structures or cord with the ultrasound probe positioned parallel to sagittal plane[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR2 "Chamberlain, P. F., Manning, F. A., Morrison, I., Harman, C. R. & Lange, I. R. Ultrasound evaluation of amniotic fluid volume. I.

Ultrasound evaluation of amniotic fluid volume. II. The relationship of increased amniotic fluid volume to perinatal outcome. Am J Obstet Gynecol 150, 250–254 (1984)."). This measurement was expressed in centimeters. Finally, the sonographer performed the amniotic fluid index (AFI) evaluation which is the sum (in centimeters) of the four largest vertical pockets of amniotic fluid, measured in each of the 4 uterus quadrants defined relative to the umbilicus and free of fetal structures or cord[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR4 "Phelan, J.

Non-inclusion criteria were multiple pregnancies, maternal chronic pathology and fetal malformation. Small for gestational age or macrosomic fetuses were not excluded and participated in the study. All these prospectively collected measurements constituted our primary database. According to French law in the context of observational studies, obtaining the written consent of the patient was not necessary. Every patient had been informed of the study by the sonographer and by a newsletter. The patient’s data may be included in the study if they did not object to their anonymous use. This study received approval by the French ethics committee under the notification number 2016/71.

### Statistical analysis

Quantitative variables were described in the study population with means and standard deviations (SD) or median and interquartiles (Q25-Q75) depending on the distribution tested with the Shapiro-Wilk statistic. For categorical variables, the comparisons of percentage were made with chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test if chi-square was not valid. Normality distribution of variables was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q plot method (supplementary materials). According to the normality of the distributions, comparisons of means between groups were performed using Student test or Mann Whitney rank sum test.

To evaluate the relationship between DVP or AFI and different maternal-fetal parameters, univariate and multivariate analysis using linear regression models were performed. Studied parameters were maternal age, BMI, fetal sex, tobacco use, nulliparity, nulligravidity and EFW. For the dependant variable SM, a logistic regression was performed and the Odds-ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were reported. The variables included in the logistic or linear models were variables, which have been shown previously to be associated with studied dependent variable (SM, DVP or AFI). The α-to-enter in the model was set at 0.20. The EFW, the maternal age and the BMI before pregnancy were included in all models. The EFW was modelled either in percentile in three categories (<10th percentile or small for gestational age (SGA); 10–90th percentile or normally grown foetuses and; >90th or large for gestational age (LGA)), or in Z-score according to gestational age[28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR28 "Hadlock, F.

## Results

During the two-week period, 1667 ultrasound scans were performed by 65 operators and included in the study. Mean maternal age was 31.6 years+/− 5.0 (range 18–46 years) and mean BMI at the beginning of pregnancy was 25.3 kg/m2+/− 4.9 (range 16.1–55.2). Distribution of BMI was as followed: <18.5 kg/m2 (2.5%), 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 (54%), 25–29.9 kg/m2 (28.4%), 30–35 kg/m2 (10.5%), >35 kg/m2 (4.6%). Thirty-eight percent of women were experiencing their first pregnancy, 47% were nulliparous, and 10.4% continued to smoke during their pregnancy. Ultrasound scan were performed at every gestational age from 18 to 40 weeks of gestation but more often at key gestational age corresponding to usual timing of French routine ultrasound: 1.5% under 21 weeks, 35% from 21–23 weeks, 13% from 24–30 weeks, 38.5% from 31–33 weeks, 7% from 34–36 weeks and 5% at term (37–40 weeks). Fetuses were female in 50%, male in 45% and undetermined or non-reported in 5%. EFW mean was 1,397.9 g +/−840.5 (range 209–5,119). The graph showing the distribution of EFW (median, 5th and 95th percentile) according to gestational age (in weeks) is presented in Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig1).

Due to the bimodal distribution of our data, grouped around second and third trimester of pregnancy corresponding to usual timing of French routine ultrasound, were decided to split our data in two. Second trimester corresponded to data ranging from 18 to 28 weeks and 6 days (n = 787); Third trimester corresponding to data from 29–40 weeks (n = 880).

Global amniotic fluid subjective evaluation (SM) classification was as followed: oligohydramnios (5.3%), normal fluid (86.8%) and polyhydramnios (7.9%) respectively. Distribution of oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios significantly differed from 2nd versus 3rd trimester, with 1.9% and 7% versus 9.2% and 9% respectively (p < 0.001). When analyzing SM categories according to EFW categories, oligohydramnios were more prevalent in the SGA category with 19.4% (versus 4.5% for normally grown fetuses and 1.4% for LGA) whereas polyhydramnios were more frequent in the LGA group with 10.8% (versus 5.4% for SGA and 7.9% for normally grown fetuses) (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis of the association between SM and EFW differed according to 2nd or 3rd trimester and according to EFW modeling. When EFW was modeled in z-score, SM classes was significantly associated with EFW, both in 2nd and 3rd trimester with p = 0.005 and p < 0.0001 respectively. When EFW was modeled in percentile (3 categories), SM classes was not significantly associated with EFW in the 2nd trimester (p = 0.42), but remained significant in the 3rd trimester (p < 0.0001). The distributions of EFW according to 2nd and 3rd trimester in each SM category are presented in Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig2).

Distribution of deepest vertical pocket (DVP) and amniotic fluid index (AFI) according to EFW and stratified by trimester are presented in Figs [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig3) and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig4) showing the bimodal distribution. In the Figs [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig5) and [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig6), distribution of DVP and AFI was also presented according to EFW in centiles in order to control for gestation (with lines represeting median, 5th and 95th percentile). Presenting the density of DVP and AFI (supplementary materials) in histograms, stratified by trimester, showed a Gaussian appearance of the data, without statistical confirmation of the normality of the distribution (Shapiro Wilk test; p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001 respectively). However, due to the Gaussian appearance of the distribution, to the high number of observations and finally to the Q-Q plot analysis (supplementary materials) the hypothesis of normality of the data has been preserved. Univariate analysis of the association between DVP and EFW differed according to 2nd or 3rd trimester and according to EFW modeling. When EFW was modeled in z-score, DVP was significantly associated with EFW, both in 2nd and 3rd trimester with p = 0.02 and p < 0.0001 respectively. When EFW was modeled in percentile (3 categories), DVP was not significantly associated in the 2nd trimester (p = 0.07), but remained significant in the 3rd trimester (p < 0.001). As for SM and DVP, univariate analysis of the association between AFI and EFW differed according to 2nd or 3rd trimester and according to EFW modeling. When EFW was modeled in z-score, AFI was significantly associated with EFW, both in 2nd and 3rd trimester with p = 0.002 and p < 0.0001 respectively. When EFW was modeled in percentile (3 categories), AFI was not significantly associated with EFW in the 2nd trimester (p = 0.06), but remained significant in the 3rd trimester (p < 0.001).

For SM evaluation, when using EFW percentile categories, no variable tested was associated with an oligohydramnios or a polyhydramnios in the 2nd trimester (Table [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Tab1)). Some variables (such as BMI < 18.5, or EFW > 90th percentile in case of oligohydramnios) were so scarce that logistic regression modeled was not able to compute precise value for odds ratio (OR). In the 3rd trimester, oligohydramnios found by SM method was significantly associated with SGA fetuses (p < 0.0001) whereas polyhydramnios found by SM was not associated with any variable including EFW in percentile (Table [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Tab2)). When switching EFW modeling into Z-score in the logistic model, oligohydramnios found by SM at 2nd or 3rd trimester was significantly associated with decreasing Z-score (p < 0.03 and p < 0.001); whereas polyhydramnios found by SM remained significant only in the 2nd trimester with increasing Z-score (p = 0.047).

An increase in DVP was found to be, in the 2nd trimester, associated with an increase in maternal age (p = 0.05) and fetal male sex (p = 0.023) but not with EFW in percentile (p = 0.13); whereas in the 3rd trimester, increasing DVP was associated strongly with EFW in percentile (more LGA and less SGA) (p < 0.0001) and BMI (overweight women and class 1 obesity) (p = 0.03). When using Z-scores of EFW, increasing DVP remained significantly associated with increasing Z-score of EFW regardless of the trimester (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001 respectively).

Finally, an increase in AFI in the 2nd trimester, was associated only with fetal male sex (p = 0.006), but not with EFW in percentile (neither SGA nor LGA) (p = 0.3); whereas in the 3rd trimester, EFW in percentile alone (more LGA and less SGA) was strongly associated with an increase in AFI (p < 0.0001). With the use of Z-scores of EFW, as for DVP, increasing AFI remained significantly associated with increasing Z-score of EFW regardless of the trimester (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001 respectively).

## Discussion

### Main Findings

Based on large population of patients scanned during a short period of time and at various gestational ages, this study showed that all three methods of amniotic fluid evaluation are significantly associated to estimated fetal weight. Other factors such as fetal male gender or maternal BMI (overweight and class I obesity) may also have an impact on the amount of amniotic fluid. SM was the method that was least often associated with estimated fetal weight especially in case of polyhydramnios showing its strong dependence to operator’s experience. DVP and AFI appeared equivalent except that maternal-fetal factors seemed to have a higher impact in DVP than AFI.

### Interpretation

To evaluate the association between amniotic fluid measurement and fetal biometry, we asked the sonographer to perform all three existing methods. We found a significant association between every method and EFW but with a different strength according to trimester stratification and EFW modeling methods. We know, from a statistical point of view that, according to the modeling method used for a continuous parameter, the results in term of significance could vary. Using Z-score of EFW in the regression model gives the advantage of having a boundless normally distributed variable with a lot of information, but less easy to interpret from a clinical point of view. On the opposite, using EFW percentile categories (SGA, normal, LGA) creates a loss of statistical information but increases the easiness of clinical interpretation. Therefore, for the second trimester analysis, where the number of SGA and LGA is small compared to third trimester, using EFW in percentile gives less significant results than Z-scores.

In France, AFI still remain a popular method and largely performed even though it has been demonstrated that DVP evaluation was more reliable[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR10 "Meyer, W.

J Ultrasound Med 30, 1573–1585 (2011)."), the use of AFI would result in an increase in the false positive rate for a diagnosis of oligohydramnios, in comparison with the single deepest vertical pocket method. In contrast, Kofinas _et al_. found that AFI was correlated to EFW percentile in the third trimester of pregnancy regardless of mother diabetic status[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR33 "Kofinas, A. & Kofinas, G. Differences in amniotic fluid patterns and fetal biometric parameters in third trimester pregnancies with and without diabetes. J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med 19, 633–638,                      https://doi.org/10.1080/14767050600822547                                         (2006)."). Although no explanation has been given for pregnancies in non-diabetic patients, it has been postulated that pregnant fetuses of diabetic patients spend more time breathing than swallowing; and it is not possible to breathe and swallow at the same time. Then, the authors postulated that fetuses of diabetic patients swallow less fluid than normal. Thus, in diabetic pregnancies, it may be necessary to consider the EFW of the fetus when interpreting variations of amniotic fluid across gestational ages. However, this study does not indicate whether this correlation is strong enough to be considered and applied clinically. In our study, the goal was not compare directly the performance of one method to another. This has been previously performed and DVP seems to be more reliable, more representative of real amniotic fluid volume and the only method associated with a reduction rate of unnecessary induction of labor and of cesarean delivery for fetal distress[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR34 "Nabhan, A. F. & Abdelmoula, Y. A. Amniotic fluid index versus single deepest vertical pocket as a screening test for preventing adverse pregnancy outcome. Cochrane Database Syst Rev, CD006593,                      https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006593.pub2                                         (2008)."). In our study, based in a population free from gestational diabetes, DVP and AFI were both influenced by EFW. We confirmed Kofinas’ findings and we also found the same association with DVP in 3rd trimester.

The least often association for SM with EFW could rely on the fact that only trained sonographer, are able to appropriately use this method. Besides, SM evaluation is not designed to accurately discriminate small variation of fetal weight and therefore is not appropriate when searching for that kind of association. In that situation, it fails to be strongly associated to parameters, due to the structure of this variable (categorical). It is more used to rapidly interpret the amount of amniotic fluid and needs to be confirmed by a precise measurement in case of suspected oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios.

Results of significant association between DVP/AFI and EFW confirmed our preliminary hypotheses. In the absence of maternal metabolic disease, fetuses with increased EFW would have had an increased DVP or AFI value. However, this association even statistically significant is not unique and other factors (male fetus, BMI, maternal age) also have an impact in the variation of the amount of amniotic fluid. This may be explained by the fact that fetal swallowing and fluid reabsorption by the mother are capable of maintaining an approximately stable amount of fluid irrespective of the amount of fetal urine produced. It can also be assumed that fetal urine production is finally only slightly influenced by the weight of the fetus. Previous studies by Adeyekun _et al_.[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR9 "Adeyekun, A. A. & Awosanya, G. G.

However, these studies did not investigate association by using DVP, and we can assume that the number of patients was not sufficient to demonstrate a significant association. Despite the recognized limitations of the ultrasound measurement of the AFI and DVP, these measures remain an important component of antenatal fetal assessment when combined with other biophysical parameters. Therefore, it seems wise to continue to consider the variation of the AFI or DVP rather than SM alone.

Some adjustment on specific variable retrieved interesting results. Tobacco smoking, nulliparity and nulligravidity, even associated with a p value less than 0.2 for some univariate analysis, ever reached significance in the multivariate analysis. Compared to national French perinatal data[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR35 "Blondel, B. et al. Trends in perinatal health in metropolitan France from 1995 to 2016: Results from the French National Perinatal Surveys. J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod 46, 701–713,                      https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogoh.2017.09.002                                         (2017)."), the patients in our sample were older (31.6 years versus 30.3 years), had a higher BMI (overweight, class I and II/III obesity: 28.4%, 10.5%, 4.6% versus 20.2%, 8.1% and 3.7% respectively), smoked less tobacco (10.4% versus 16.6%) and were more often nulliparous (46.8% versus 42.2%). Therefore, our “low risk population” according to the study design might be slightly at higher risk than expected. However, we believe that non-significance of the aforementioned variables might be probably due to the strong impact of some variables such as EFW in the model.

A significant impact of BMI was observed for DVP assessed in the overweight and class I obesity group. In obese or overweight patients, literature has shown that the risk of macrosomia was strongly increased (OR 1.7–2.4) independently of the presence of gestational diabetes[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR36 "Weiss, J. L. et al. Obesity, obstetric complications and cesarean delivery rate–a population-based screening study. Am J Obstet Gynecol 190, 1091–1097,                      https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2003.09.058                                         (2004)."). We could assume that increasing BMI is associated with increased EFW also associated with increased amniotic fluid volume. But, as an adjustment on EFW was performed, another possible assumption is that obese women do have a bigger placenta that produces higher amniotic fluid volume than smaller ones. The fact that this association was only observed with DVP and not AFI could be related to more difficult ultrasound examination in obese than in normal BMI patients[37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR37 "Fuchs, F. et al.

Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 41, 40–46,                      https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.12311                                         (2013)."). The margins of error in the measures for the calculation of AFI may be greater, explaining why the association is not detected with that method.

Perni _et al_.[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR12 "Perni, S. C., Predanic, M., Cho, J. E., Kalish, R. B. & Chasen, S. T. Association of amniotic fluid index with estimated fetal weight. J Ultrasound Med 23, 1449–1452; quiz 1453 (2004).") found, in the third trimester of pregnancy, a significant correlation between EFW and AFI only in female fetuses (p < 0.001; r = 0.31). The correlation was significant for both fetal genders only after 38 weeks of gestation (p = 0.03 and r = 0.30). These results are not consistent with our results since we found an association between male fetus and DVP or AFI in the second trimester. Again, as for BMI, male fetuses are bigger than girl and therefore produce higher amount of amniotic fluid. But, as an adjustment on EFW was performed, we could then only assume that fetal urine production is probably higher in male fetus.

### Strengths and Limitations

Several strengths of our study should be mentioned. This is a large prospective multicentre study with experienced sonographers evaluating all the three methods of amniotic fluid evaluation when other studies mainly focused on AFI. Sonographers participating in the study had first to take an online training course reviewing the aims of the study, the inclusion criteria and the methodology to assess the amniotic fluid through the three methods, in order to reduce inter-observer variability. Only sonographers who completed the course and passed the final test were eligible to participate in the study. The large number of ultrasound scans performed in this study (1667 scans) enables us to produce precise and robust evaluation of associations. It gave us the power to observe relationship between parameters that were in other studies not visible due to the lack of power. Moreover, we studied the association over a long period of pregnancy ranging from 18 to 40 weeks to cover the maximum pregnancy time, unlike the other studies that were mainly limited to the third trimester of pregnancy. Several papers have examined the volume of amniotic fluid by gestational age, but with ultrasound data coming from a few hundred patients. Magann _et al_.[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR14 "Magann, E. F., Sandlin, A. T. & Ounpraseuth, S. T. Amniotic fluid and the clinical relevance of the sonographically estimated amniotic fluid volume: oligohydramnios. J Ultrasound Med 30, 1573–1585 (2011)."), for example, published percentile curves for DVP and AFI as a function of gestational age with data from 291 patients. Because of the large number of patients included in our study, we believe that these measurements can become a good database and can be used, later, to create new AFI and DVP percentile curves according to gestational age. However, a selection of very low risk patients with an EFW ranging from 10 to 90th percentile would be the first step of this study. Then, it would be interesting to compare these curves with other curves published in the literature.

Some weakness may also be mentioned. Quantitative assessment methods such as DVP and AFI have the theoretical advantage of being reproducible and comparative. However, the measures themselves and the choice of the tank are largely subjective and vary greatly from one observer to another. We still often find, for the same pregnancies at the same term, with great disparities in the values of AFI or DVP in particular according to the observers. Despite the precautions taken to prevent this inter-observer variability in the measurement of biometrics and the quantity of liquid, it will remain the main bias in our study because there were 65 different sonographers. This variability is inescapable but it shows the real life. Another limitation relies on the absence of flow chart. We do not have any information regarding the number and the characteristics of the patient that refused to be included in the study. We agree with the fact that it could have created a selection bias if many of potentially includable patients were not included. However, due to the high number of women included by a restricted number of sonographer during a very short period of time, we believe that the number of patient missed to be included is relatively low. Another limitation relies on the lack of information at birth for the fetus included. In fact, as the goal of this study was only to answer the question of a sonographic association at a precise point of time, we do not have the longitudinal follow up of those pregnancies and therefore we do not have any other information on birthweight. This could have created a classification bias if we consider that the informations provided by the sonographer were wrong. Finally we were not able to compare the three methods in order to find the best one; but this was not the aim of our study.

In conclusion, our study, based on a large amount of data obtained during a short period of time, demonstrates that every method for assessing amniotic fluid estimation was associated with estimated fetal weight with more accurate precision at the third trimester.

## Abstract

_Background_. Amniotic fluid index (AFI) is one of the major and deciding components of fetal biophysical profile and by itself it can predict pregnancy outcome. Very low values are associated with intrauterine growth restriction and renal anomalies of fetus, whereas high values may indicate fetal GI anomalies, maternal diabetes mellitus, and so forth. However, before deciding the cut-off standards for abnormal values for a local population, what constitutes a normal range for specific gestational age and the ideal interval of testing should be defined. _Objectives_. To establish reference standards for AFI for local population after 34 weeks of pregnancy and to decide an optimal scan interval for AFI estimation in third trimester in low risk antenatal women. _Materials and Methods_. A prospective estimation of AFI was done in 50 healthy pregnant women from 34 to 40 weeks at weekly intervals. The trend of amniotic fluid volume was studied with advancing gestational age. Only low risk singleton pregnancies with accurately established gestational age who were available for all weekly scan from 34 to 40 weeks were included in the study. Women with gestational or overt diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders of the pregnancy, prelabour rupture of membranes, and congenital anomalies in the foetus and those who delivered before 40 completed weeks were excluded from the study. For the purpose of AFI measurement, the uterine cavity was arbitrarily divided into four quadrants by a vertical and horizontal line running through umbilicus. Linear array transabdominal probe was used to measure the largest vertical pocket (in cm) in perpendicular plane to the abdominal skin in each quadrant. Amniotic fluid index was obtained by adding these four measurements. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (Version 16, Chicago, IL). Percentile curves (5th, 50th, and 95th centiles) were constructed for comparison with other studies. Cohen’s _d_ coefficient was used to examine the magnitude of change at different time intervals. _Results_. Starting from 34 weeks till 40 weeks, 50 ultrasound measurements were available at each gestational age. The mean (standard deviation) of AFI values (in cms) were 34 W: 14.59 (1.79), 35 W: 14.25 (1.57), 36 W: 13.17 (1.56), 37 W: 12.48 (1.52), 38 W: 12.2 (1.7), and 39 W: 11.37 (1.71). The 5th percentile cut-off was 8.7 cm at 40 weeks. There was a gradual decline of AFI values as the gestational age approached term. Significant drop in AFI was noted at two-week intervals. AFI curve generated from the study varied significantly when compared with already published data, both from India and abroad. _Conclusion_. Normative range for AFI values for late third trimester was established. Appreciable changes occurred in AFI values as gestation advanced by two weeks. Hence, it is recommended to follow up low risk antenatal women every two weeks after 34 weeks of pregnancy. The percentile curves of AFI obtained from the present study may be used to detect abnormalities of amniotic fluid for our population.

## 1\. Introduction

The ultimate goal of antepartum surveillance program is to improve perinatal outcome and to decrease intrauterine fetal demise besides prevention of maternal morbidity and mortality \[[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0001), [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0002)\]. A fetus in distress should be identified at the earliest so that timely delivery will not only salvage the fetus but also prevent long term neurological impairments such as injury to fetal central nervous system \[[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0003)\]. Though it is said that such an event is more common in high risk pregnancies, the fetuses belonging to low risk mothers are not totally immune \[[4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0004)\]. There are definite guidelines for frequency of antenatal testing for high risk pregnant women, but what constitutes an ideal screening program for low risk pregnancies is still unknown \[[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0005)\].

Amniotic fluid assessment by ultrasound is one of the important tools in assessing the fetal health in all risk categories especially beyond the period of viability \[[6](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0006)\]. Though there are several ways \[[7](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0007)\] to assess quantity of amniotic fluid ranging from clinical palpation to measurement of single deepest vertical pocket \[[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0008)\], amniotic fluid index (AFI) by four-quadrant technique as described by Phelan et al. \[[9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0009)\] in 1987 and among them AFI is popular and reliable method of quantifying amniotic fluid till today. AFI is one of the essential components of fetal biophysical profile (BPP) and its values correlate well with adequacy of fetal renal perfusion. Normally it peaks at 32 to 34 weeks of gestation and thereafter there is a gradual reduction in amniotic fluid due to increase in concentrating capacity of fetal kidneys \[[10](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0010)\]. However, a drastic reduction in its quantity may indicate underlying placental insufficiency, which has definite implications on growing fetus. The values between 8 and 25 are considered to be normal, 5–8 low normal, and less than 5 oligoamnios \[[11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0011)\]. At values less than 5, there is higher incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality and many a time immediate delivery is the only way out \[[12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0012), [13](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0013)\]. Hence it is very important to scan the patient to note such a trend periodically during antenatal visits. AFI is the fifth parameter in traditional five-point biophysical profile and second parameter in rapid two-point modified BPP (the other one being NST) \[[14](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0014)\]. Though there is no definite said protocol for identifying compromised fetus, many believe that biweekly nonstress test and AFI assessment should be offered to all women at risk \[[15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0015)\]. But what constitutes an ideal frequency of AFI monitoring for low risk pregnancy is still unknown. Frequent monitoring adds to the cost and maternal anxiety and optimizing the ultrasound examinations is the need of the day.

The present study is an effort to examine the quantum of decrease in AFI in the third trimester and interval of scanning to detect a significant change, thereby formulating guidelines for antenatal ultrasound examinations in low risk women.

## 2\. Aims and Objectives

The purpose of the present investigation is


- (1)
to study the pattern of change in AFI on weekly basis from 34 weeks till delivery;

- (2)
to constitute reference ranges of AFI from 34 to 40 weeks of gestation;

- (3)
to find the time interval by which there is a significant fall in AFI, which will help obstetrician to plan an ideal protocol for antenatal ultrasound examination in the third trimester.


## 3\. Materials and Methods

This was a prospective observational study conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, from January 2012 to December 2012. Institutional ethical committee approval was obtained prior to study. Inclusion criteria were low risk singleton pregnancy, starting gestational age of 34 weeks, reliable last menstrual period and dates correlated and confirmed by comparison with first trimester CRL (Crown Rump Length). Once initial criteria were met, those who were subsequently diagnosed to have abnormalities of liquor volume due to conditions such as hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and placental insufficiency were excluded from the study, so as to obtain normative data. Only those patients who delivered at 40 weeks were included in the study as we wanted longitudinal data till term. The final study subjects were 50 low risk pregnant women who underwent serial scans at weekly interval starting from 34 weeks till term.

The subjects belonged to the local population consisting mainly of Tuluva, Billava, Bunt, Koraga, Kulala, Devadiga, Konkanis, Shivalli Brahmins, Bayri Muslim, and Catholic communities, the spoken language mainly being Kannada, Tulu, and Konkani. The women were medium built, the average height was of 152 to 156 cms, and prepregnancy weight was between 45 and 50 kg.

The ultrasound examination was carried out after instructing the patient to empty her bladder. The examinations were performed with a convex 3.5 MHz probe (Philips HD11XE ultrasound equipment). The patient was asked to lie down in supine position. Uterus was arbitrarily divided into four quadrants using linea nigra as a vertical line and a transverse line passing through umbilicus, as described by Phelan et al. \[[9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0009)\]. The transducer was placed in each of these quadrants in sagittal plane perpendicular to patient’s abdomen and maximum depth of amniotic fluid was calculated in centimeters excluding the cord loops and small fetal parts. Caution was exercised to avoid excessive pressure on the transducer as it can alter AFI measurements. The values of all four quadrants were added to obtain the final amniotic fluid index (AFI).

### 3.1. Sample Size Estimation

Khadilkar et al. \[[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0016)\] from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Grant Medical College, Mumbai, conducted a prospective, cross sectional study in low risk healthy pregnant subjects to obtain a gestational reference range for AFI among Indian women. They noted that the mean and standard deviation of AFI (cm) at 34 weeks of gestation was 14.2 and 2.4, respectively. We hypothesised that a difference of 1.5 cm in the mean AFI would be significantly different from the normal values and accordingly estimated sample size to show a desired level of power of 90% and level of significance 0.05, by using the formula,



![mathematical equation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/58e9a341-4734-4908-9540-12fd5147f9cc/jp319204-math-0001.png)(1)

where _z_ _α_ = 1.96 (critical value that divides the central 95% of _z_ distribution from 5% in the tails), _z_ _β_ = 1.28 (critical value that separates the lower 10% of distribution from upper 90%), _σ_ = standard deviation, and _μ_ 1 − _μ_ 0 = difference of two means.

Accordingly it was estimated that 27 patients are required and we decided to recruit 50 patients to have satisfactory results.

## 4\. Statistical Methods

Data was analyzed using SPSS version 16 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive analysis was performed to obtain mean, standard deviation, and percentile values for AFI from 34 to 40 weeks. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to plot percentile values (5th, 50th, and 95th) across various gestational ages. A polynomial regression analysis of 3rd order was used to find the best fit. The decline in AFI value was calculated at weekly interval and the magnitude of change was analyzed by effect size estimation (Cohen _d_ coefficient) \[[17](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0017)\].

The formula for Cohen’s _d_ is given as follows:



![mathematical equation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/72c8c7b2-3d16-49f7-a4df-be5160b9b3dc/jp319204-math-0002.png)(2)

where _M_ 1 and _M_ 2 are the means and _s_ 1 and _s_ 2 are the standard deviations of two groups.

## 5\. Results

Of the 50 patients who were recruited for the study and were between the age of 22 to 28 years, more than half (32 patients, 64%) were primigravidae and 18 (36%) were multigravidae. None of them had any antenatal complications. All of them delivered at around 39+ to 40 weeks. 16 (32%) patients required caesarean delivery for obstetric indication such as failed induction, cephalopelvic disproportion, and fetal distress in labour. The mean (standard deviation) birth weight of the neonates (measured in kg) was 2.83 (0.34), with 1st minute APGAR score (mean and standard deviation) of 8.48 (1.09) and 5th minute APGAR was 8.72 (1.01). As mentioned in methodology, we have excluded those who delivered before term as we required AFI from 34 weeks to 40 weeks of gestation for analysis purpose.

Table [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#tbl-0001 "Link to table") describes the descriptive data for AFI. The AFI values differed throughout the gestation and there was a gradual decline in the values as pregnancy advanced. The 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles ranged from 11.7, 14.6, and 17.3, respectively, at 34 weeks to 8.7, 10.8, and 13.7, respectively, at 40 weeks. It is interesting to note that all the values were within 8 to 25 cm range (which is accepted and established normal range for AFI values worldwide). The maximum value of AFI in any single patient was 17.6 cm and minimum 8.5 cm in our series of low risk antenatal pregnant women. If minimum (5th centile) and maximum (95th centile) are considered as normal range, it was noted that the corresponding values too were different at different gestational ages; the more advanced the gestational age, the lesser the values. These changes are graphically represented in Figure [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#fig-0001).

Graphical representation of AFI centiles at various gestational ages.

We used difference in mean values of one week to the next week to evaluate the decreasing trend of amniotic fluid from 34 to 40 weeks of gestation (Table [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#tbl-0002 "Link to table")). Dark shaded area indicates cells where calculations are not required as they are the same weeks or previous weeks. It can be seen that many cells have the values less than 1, but still the difference may be calculated statistically significant if ordinary statistical tests such as paired _t_ test were applied and hence we have used Cohen’s test which very well detects the magnitude of change.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Table [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#tbl-0003 "Link to table") indicates Cohen’s _d_ values for week to week comparison and it can be seen that not much change was seen in immediate week, but changes became significant when the interval between two scans was more than 2 weeks or more in most of the comparisons. Hence from this table there is substantial evidence that liquor volume decreases significantly over the period of 14 days more in low risk antenatal women.

Our results indicated that from 34 weeks onwards there is a gradual reduction in AFI. Using polynomial regression analysis, we have established reference standards for AFI ranges from 34 to 40 weeks (Figure [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#fig-0002)). The regression analysis further showed that there was a good degree of correlation between GA (gestational age) and AFI ( _R_ 2 = 0.89 to 0.95; _P_ < 0.005).

## 6\. Discussion

Amniotic fluid production and regulation is a complex and dynamic process involving the fetus, placenta, and mother. Amniotic fluid volume gradually increases till 32–34 weeks of gestation and thereafter there is a gradual reduction till term \[[18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0018), [19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0019)\]. The critical AFI range of 8 to 25 cm signifies fetal well-being and the deviation from this range is associated with increase in fetal and maternal complications due to oligoamnios and polyhydramnios. The third trimester AFI values are proportionate to fetal urine production \[[20](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0020), [21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0021)\] and hence in normal range indicate good placental perfusion and fetal nutrient and oxygen transfer. Hence monitoring the AFI has become a standard of antenatal care.

There is wide variation in reference standards for mean AFI values according to population, race, and geography. Table [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#tbl-0004 "Link to table") compares our finding with that of other authors \[[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0016), [22](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0022)–[25](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0025)\]. We have also graphically interpreted findings in the other studies (either mean or 50th percentile values) in Figure [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#fig-0003). However, it is noticeable that majority of the studies agree that from 34 weeks onward there is a gradual fall in AFI values. The two studies \[[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0016), [25](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0025)\] are from India, but the reported AFI range has a wide range. This may be because their observations were based upon retrospective cross sectional data. It is noticeable that AFI reference values published by Singh et al. are 2 to 3 cm more than all other series at all gestational ages; we presume this may be because the study was done in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, where patients from very high socioeconomic status are catered. Khadilkar et al. reported their findings from patients attending antenatal clinic of Grant Medical College, Bombay, and our findings too match with their data. Hence, it can be opined that AFI standards have to be defined for specific populations in order to eliminate bias resulting from socioeconomic groups, geographical locations, race, and so forth. However, it must be noted that almost all authors have reported a steady decline in AFI values with the advancing gestational age, except Birang et al. from Iran. Their series included retrospective cross sectional data and the number differed from minimum of 12 observations at 35 weeks to maximum of 68 observations at 39 weeks. This might be the reason for their finding of rapid fall of AFI from 34 to 35 weeks, plateauing between 37 and 39 weeks and once again slow fall at 40 weeks. Such observations indicate weakness of cross sectional cohort, as the same patients are not followed up sequentially.

Comparison of AFI values at different gestational ages in various studies.

Amniotic fluid once thought to be a stagnant pool with approximate turn over time of twenty-four hours. In high risk pregnancies complicated by chronic placental insufficiency liquor is known to drastically reduce in a shorter time and it has been recommended to perform AFI estimation once in three days or at times even frequently depending upon other fetal well-being surveillance tools such as Doppler assessment of fetal circulation. However, there is no universal consensus regarding the frequency of AFI estimation in low risk antenatal women. Hence, it is important to determine a critical interval at which the fall in AFI becomes clinically significant.

We have not used statistical significance test (involving estimation of _P_ value) such as _paired_ _t_ _test_ for comparing AFI values at different gestational ages, as these tests tend to give significant _P_ values even when a minor variation exists in the means of two groups. When sample size is sufficiently large, even the fractional differences are likely to be reported as significant _P_ values, hence giving meaningless interpretations. Instead, we have calculated effect size estimate (Cohen _d_) to quantify the changes in the AFI over a period of time.

Effect size is a simple measure for quantifying the difference between two groups or the same group over time, on a common scale. There are several methods mentioned in the literature to calculate the effect sizes (Cohen 1988 \[[17](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0017)\], Rosenthal and Rosnow 1991 \[[26](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0026)\], Partial Eta squared Richardson 2011 \[[27](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/319204#bib-0027)\]) and so forth. However, we have used Cohen’s _d_ estimate as described by Cohen 1988, to calculate effect sizes as this method is easy, simple to understand and can be applied to any measured outcome in scientific study.

From our statistical analysis, we have found that there is no much decrease in AFI at interval of one week, but thereafter the differences become large and significant. Hence, it appears that when the liquor is within normal range, the chances of fetal jeopardy are unlikely to occur within next week; one can safely repeat the AFI after 2 weeks. At the time of estimation of AFI, one can also perform other tests for foetal well-being such as documentation of gross foetal body movements, foetal tone, and foetal breathing movements to be assured that foetus is not hypoxic. In addition, interval biometry may be done at whenever required to quantify satisfactory foetal growth. In the absence of any maternal or foetal risk factors, we are of the opinion that AFI estimation once in fortnight is good enough to ensure satisfactory pregnancy outcome.

## 7\. Conclusions

We have established not only gestational specific normative AFI reference standards for late third trimester (34 to 40 weeks) for our local population but also magnitude of change in AFI values at weekly interval by quantitative analysis using effect size statistics. Strength of present study is that it is based on longitudinal data of normal healthy pregnant women and percentile curves obtained can be used to define what constitutes normal range of AFI for low risk antenatal patients. Though our results are based on required number of patients by sample size determination, larger number of subjects if studied may yield robust reference curves for AFI and identify extreme values to define what constitutes oligo- or polyhydramnios. The same study can be extended to high risk pregnancies such as preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, multiple gestation, and intrauterine growth restriction, in order to determine the frequency of liquor testing for these cohorts.

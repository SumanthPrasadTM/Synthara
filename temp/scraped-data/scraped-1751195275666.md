## Abstract

Fetal biometry and amniotic fluid volume assessments are two essential yet repetitive tasks in fetal ultrasound screening scans, aiding in the detection of potentially life-threatening conditions. However, these assessment methods can occasionally yield unreliable results. Advances in deep learning have opened up new avenues for automated measurements in fetal ultrasound, demonstrating human-level performance in various fetal ultrasound tasks. Nevertheless, the majority of these studies are retrospective in silico studies, with a limited number including African patients in their datasets. In this study we developed and prospectively assessed the performance of deep learning models for end-to-end automation of fetal biometry and amniotic fluid volume measurements. These models were trained using a newly constructed database of 172,293 de-identified Moroccan fetal ultrasound images, supplemented with publicly available datasets. the models were then tested on prospectively acquired video clips from 172 pregnant people forming a consecutive series gathered at four healthcare centers in Morocco. Our results demonstrate that the 95% limits of agreement between the models and practitioners for the studied measurements were narrower than the reported intra- and inter-observer variability among expert human sonographers for all the parameters under study. This means that these models could be deployed in clinical conditions, to alleviate time-consuming, repetitive tasks, and make fetal ultrasound more accessible in limited-resource environments.

Fetal biometry and amniotic fluid volume are essential but strenuous measurements in fetal ultrasound screening. Here, the authors show that deep learning models can automate these measurements with high accuracy, using a large and diverse dataset of Moroccan fetal ultrasound images.

## Introduction

Ultrasound (US) is a low-cost, non-invasive imaging modality that has been shown to independently reduce fetal mortality by up to 20%[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR1). Yet, 99% of preventable fetal and maternal deaths occur in developing countries where access to fetal ultrasound is scarce and more than a third of operators have no training at all[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR3). The WHO recommends at least one US examination for each pregnancy[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR4); however, there is a shortage of physicians and sonographers able to perform this examination primarily in countries of the Global South[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR5). These countries are not the only ones suffering from excessive and increasing fetal and maternal mortality. The USA ranks last amongst industrialized countries in terms of maternal mortality with notable ethnic differences: African-American women are three times more likely to die during pregnancy compared to non-Hispanic White women[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR6). Thus, democratizing access to healthcare resources dedicated to fetal and maternal health, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or geographic location, is a global healthcare priority.

Two vital and systematic assessments of all routine screening scans are fetal biometry (FB) and amniotic fluid volume (AFV). FB and AFV help detect and manage potential life-threatening conditions. FB is used to determine gestational age (GA), which is essential to guide therapeutic interventions in the case of pre-term labor or pre-eclampsia and detect pregnancy-related complications, such as fetal growth restriction (FGR). FGR, sometimes defined as the “failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor”[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR7), is responsible for 30% of all stillbirths and poor neonatal outcomes. Its diagnosis can rely solely on US FB assessment when abdominal circumference (AC) or estimated fetal weight (EFW) falls below the 3rd percentile[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR8), [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR9). AFV abnormalities are strongly associated with increased mortality in the case of low AFV (oligohydramnios)[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR10). The single deepest pocket (SDP) method has been proven to be as reliable as the amniotic fluid index method (AFI) for AFV assessment but to cause fewer false positive diagnoses for oligohydramnios and, therefore, fewer unnecessary labor inductions.

FB coupled with AFV assessments are time-consuming, repetitive, and error-prone tasks, and several studies have stressed the need for quality audits to ensure measurement reproducibility and lower inter and intra-observer variability[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR11)– [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR13).

Advances in deep learning (DL) applied to medical imaging have sparked interest in its application to measurement automation in fetal ultrasound, with studies showcasing human-level performances of DL models in standard plane classification and segmentation[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR14)– [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR17). Most of them are retrospective “in silico” studies conducted on Caucasian populations on fixed images, except for a few exceptions[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR18). To the best of our knowledge, no African team has ever led a study on African patients to automate fetal ultrasound tasks using DL. We believe it to be of the utmost importance that the Global South should not simply import Artificial Intelligence (AI) breakthroughs in medicine from the Global North, but rather developed mindfully, and responsibly by researchers aware of the local constraints and characteristics[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR19).

Furthermore, no previous work has tried to develop an understandable approach to the automation of both tasks respecting the quality guidelines set forth by the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) for the FB workflow or allowing an end-to-end automation of the AFV assessment workflow, (see Related Methods below for extensive comparison with existing methods). Recent approaches using “blind” cine-loops represent a paradigm shift as they do seem to allow for the democratization of gestational age estimation and their use by minimally trained sonographers but fail to promote both the autonomy and education of the operators[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR18), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR20).

An end-to-end, understandable, FB and AFV assessment workflow automation could not only potentially alleviate practitioners’ burden, increase ultrasound sensitivity and specificity, and even enable minimally trained healthcare workers to perform these measurements in resource-stranded environments but also empower them to learn how to perform these tasks in the absence of such a tool.

Here we train and test DL models, in clinical conditions, to effectively automate these two tasks from standardized free-hand videos.

## Results

### Data

To train and test DL models meant to fully automate FB and AFV assessment, the models were trained on a newly built database of 172,293 de-identified fetal ultrasound images from 12,356 US exams done in six health centers in two different cities in Morocco between 2015 and 2021. In addition, publicly available datasets were used with the following ultrasound machines: General Electric’s Voluson E6, E8, E10, S8, and S10, and Aloka[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR17).

Within the collected data, 30,249 2D standard biometry planes of the abdomen, brain, and femur were preprocessed to extract pixelated annotations. The preprocessing allows it to recognize the region of interest, then to detect the pixelated colored calipers and circumferences to generate the ground truth masks for the abdomen and brain. The femur was annotated directly by the annotators. Optical character recognition (OCR) techniques were used to extract the information and acronyms about the standard plan and the biometric measurements as measured by the doctors during screening. In the end, the annotators validated the extracted masks, standard plan, and measurements (see supplementary information file for details).

In total, fifteen human annotators (ranging from medical students to Radiology and Obstetrics professors) participated in the annotation process using our bespoke annotation platform based on the open-source tool Label Studio version 1.3.0[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR21) that we adapted to our needs. Each annotation indicated the type of standard plane (abdomen, brain, femur), a polygonal segmentation in the case of the femur, and some of the quality criteria associated with it as described by the ISUOG guidelines[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR22) (Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Tab1)). The annotators made a further distinction between transthalamic, transcerebellar, and transventricular planes. Quality criteria such as the zoom (head, abdomen, femur occupying more than half of the image – caliper placement – the angle of the femur to the horizontal <45°) were omitted in the annotation process. Instead, their detection was automated through fetal structure segmentation: calculating the surface ratio of the structure to the whole image or the angle of the femur to the horizontal to determine conformity to the criteria described by Salomon et al.[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR23) (Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Tab1)). That step was designed to ensure that the models select the best suitable plane on a given video loop, detecting the presence or absence of the quality criteria, and displaying them with the measurement, allowing an insight into the model’s choice as well as a correction if necessary.

Images were also annotated according to the presence or absence of an AF pocket, defined as an in-utero fluid pocket free of fetal parts or the umbilical cord. In the case of the presence of the AF pocket, annotators were asked to segment it manually.

‘Doctors’ refer to physicians who prospectively and manually annotated standard planes. ‘Semi-automatic’ refers to the process of the standard plane and biometric measurement recognition using Optical Character Recognition, validated by a trained research technician. Helena Pinheiro [https://www.hpinheiro.com/](https://www.hpinheiro.com/) created this illustration.

### Segmentation and classification models

We assessed the performances of the segmentation and classification models on the retrospective test sets, comparing them to the experts’ annotations for standard plane detection, quality criteria detection, brain, abdomen, and femur structure segmentation, and AF pocket detection and segmentation.

We used a set of Mask-R-CNN architectures for the standard plane detection and anatomical regions (brain, abdomen, and femur) segmentation[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR24). Mask-R-CNN models are widely used in the state-of-the-art literature. However, the datasets used for training and testing the models were not sufficient to efficiently evaluate their performance and they have been used only for one single task of fetal biometry. For example, Al-Bander et al. and Moccia et al. adapted the Mask-R-CNN architecture to assess HC measurement using the HC18 dataset[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR25), [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR26). Mask-R-CNN models are generally used, for instance, segmentation. The idea is to train models that can detect two or more instances of an object in the images, for example, two femurs, two heads in the case of twins, or separable regions of the amniotic fluid region. Mask-R-CNN has a backbone architecture with a certain number of network depth features that are taken from a certain number of final convolutional layers on a certain training schedule. The notation used to nominate the architectures used in the experiment is the same used by detectron2[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR27). For example, R\_50\_C5\_3x is a Mask-R-CNN architecture with ResNet as a backbone. It has 50 depth features taken from the convolutional layer of the fifth stage and a training schedule of 3x, which means 1 iteration every 3 × 12 (36) epochs.

In our study, four Mask-R-CNN models were finetuned (R\_101\_C4\_3x, R\_101\_DC5\_3x, R\_50\_C4\_3x, R\_50\_DC5\_3x) for the segmentation of the brain, abdomen, and femur using 30249 annotated images (10527 brains, 10227 abdomens, and 9495 femurs). The R\_50\_DC5\_3x model achieves the best performance with an average DICE score of 0.89 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.82 versus 0.96 and 0.90 respectively, reported with the FUVAI model[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR14) (Fig. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig2)). The Segmentation of the brain region achieved the best performance with a DICE score of 0.95 and an IoU of 0.91.

These models (R\_101\_C4\_3x, R\_101\_DC5\_3x, R\_50\_C4\_3x, R\_50\_DC5\_3x) were trained for the segmentation of the abdominal, femoral, and brain planes on the retrospective test set. The bar plot shows the segmentation performances on the three biometric structures, and the heatmap plots show the DICE (left) and IoU (right) scores per structure. The R\_50\_DC5\_3x model achieves the best performance with a DICE score of 0.89 and an IoU score of 0.82. The segmentation of the brain achieved the best performance with a DICE score of 0.95 and an IoU score of 0.91.

For each biometry plane, classification models for quality criteria detection were assessed on the test set of the retrospective data (Fig. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig3)). Assessment of the quality of the standard biometry plane allows for better reproducibility of the AC measurement, we assessed 4 quality criteria (kidneys not visible (A\_KN), plane showing portal sinus (A\_PS), plane showing stomach bubble (A\_SB), symmetrical plane (A\_SYM)) leaving out the image zoom quality criteria that are the only one that is not qualitative and can be inferred directly from the abdomen segmentation. Based on three finetuned models (INCEPTIONV3, RESNET50V2, and VGG16), we obtained F1 scores of 0.81, 0.80, and 0.80, respectively, INCEPTIONV3 shows the best results for all the criteria with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86, and an F1 score of 0.81. The results also show that the A\_SB criterion is detected better compared to other criteria with an AUC of INCEPTIONV3 of 0.93.

Overall, the three models show similar results for the cephalic plane quality criteria, and INCEPTIONV3 shows the best results for the abdominal criteria with an average AUC of 0.86. Legends: (kidneys not visible (A\_KN), portal sinus visible (A\_PS), stomach bubble visible (A\_SB), abdominal plane symmetry (A\_SYM), brain plane symmetry (B\_SYM), cerebellum not visible (B\_CB), cavum septum visible (B\_CS), posterior horn of lateral ventricle visible (B\_PVV) and thalami visible (B\_TH)) on the retrospective test set. The top row shows the classification per model, and the bottom row shows the results per quality criteria.

For the classification of the brain plane, five quality criteria were assessed: cerebellum not visible (B\_CB), plane showing cavum septum pellucidity (B\_CS), plane showing posterior horn of lateral ventricles (B\_PVV), symmetrical plane (B\_SYM) and plane showing thalami (B\_TH). Similarly, the 3 classification models were finetuned for this task. They show very similar results with an average AUC of 0.83. We obtained F1 scores of 0.66, 0.62, and 0.62 for INCEPTIONV3, RESNET50V2, and VGG16, respectively. The results also show that the B\_CB criterion is well detected compared to other criteria with an AUC of INCEPTIONV3 of 0.95 (Fig. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig3)).

For the femoral plane, the performances of the model designed to detect if both ends of the femur are clearly visible were poor as inter-observer variability was high in the training set; thus, it was not used for image quality scoring. For the femoral plane on the prospective part of the study, the size, subsequent femur to image sizes ratio, and angle of the femur were directly obtained from the femur segmentation stage and kept as the only quality criteria.

For the AF pocket classification, we compared the finetuned models (INCEPTIONV3, RESNET50V2, and VGG16) on the retrospective test set (Fig. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig4)). The results show almost equivalent AUC scores of 0.89, and F1 scores of 0.81, 0.78, and 0.80, respectively. Similarly, we compared seven finetuned Mask-R-CNN models (‘R\_101\_C4\_3x’, ‘R\_101\_DC5\_3x’, ‘R\_101\_FPN\_3x’, ‘R\_50\_C4\_3x’, ‘R\_50\_DC5\_3x’, ‘R\_50\_FPN\_3x’, ‘X\_101\_32x8d\_FPN\_3x’) for the segmentation of the AF pocket region (Fig. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig4)). These models were trained on 3773 images manually annotated with polygons by the experts out of 6199 ones that were annotated as containing AF pocket from the total number of 11926 images.

The results show that ‘X\_101\_32x8d\_FPN\_3x’ achieved the best performance with a DICE score of 0.78 and an IoU of 0.71 versus a DICE of 0.877 for the state-of-the-art model by Cho et al.[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR28) who tested the model on only 125 images.

In this retrospective study, we adopted the finetuned R\_50\_DC5\_3x model for the segmentation of the brain, abdomen, and femur, the finetuned INCEPTIONV3 models for the quality criteria and the AF pocket detection, and the finetuned X\_101\_32x8d\_FPN\_3x model for the AF pocket segmentation. These models will then be evaluated based on the prospectively acquired data.

### Models performance on the prospective evaluation

From October 2021 to April 2022, 172 patients with singleton pregnancies were included in our prospective study, the average age of the participants was 30.38 years (minimum: 18, maximum: 44, standard deviation: 6.05), most of the included patients did not have any comorbidity (87%), ten patients lived with diabetes mellitus (6%) and three lived with a hypertensive disorder (2%). 34 patients (20%) were nulliparous, 47 (27%) were primiparous, and 91 (53%) were multiparous. Multiple pregnancies were not an exclusion criterion, and patients were included even in the case of partially complete examinations. However, duplicates and patients without an image or cine-loop available or no corresponding ground truth measurement obtained were excluded (Fig. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig5)). In total, the study gathered: 142 different cine-loops containing a femoral plane; 144 containing an abdominal plane; 123 containing a cephalic plane; and 90 containing AF pockets. GA estimation from first-trimester ultrasound from crown-rump length measurement (CRL) was unavailable in almost all cases (see supplementary data [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#MOESM4)).

#### Fig. 5. Study flow chart.

172 patients were analyzed and 99 were excluded mainly because the measurements corresponding to cine-loops were not saved by the operators ( _n_ = 43), followed by the absence of valid cine-loops recorded ( _n_ = 38), no data recorded during the study ( _n_ = 17) and duplicates ( _n_ = 1).

Overall, the mean GA estimated by the operators was of 30 weeks and 3.13 days ± 6 weeks and 3.1 days (range: 15 weeks and 2 days – 41 weeks and 2 days), the mean measured HC, BPD, AC, FL, EFW, and SDP were respectively of 26.37 ± 5.88 cm (range: 11.29–34.71 cm), 7.41 ± 1.72 cm (range: 3.09–10.07 cm), 23.98 ± 6.58 cm (range: 8.95–38.18 cm), 5.28 ± 1.44 cm (range: 1.52–7.86 cm), 1606.78 ± 957.56 g (range: 108.81–3783.86 g) and 5.25 ± 2.22 cm (range: 2.15–17.37 cm).

The US machines and healthcare centers from which the prospective data differed from those of the retrospective data were retained. Three of the four centers where the prospective part of the study was conducted did not participate in the retrospective data collection. Several US machines used in the prospective testing were not present in the retrospective data as well: Mindray DC 40 and Resona 6, Philips Medical Systems Affinity 50 W, 70 G, and GE Voluson P8.

When possible, EFW and GA were computed from all measurements using the recommended Hadlock and Intergrowth formulae[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR29), [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR30) and all necessary measurements performed by the doctors with the corresponding available cine-loops.

The models segmented each relevant anatomical region and then extracted the planes with the highest composite score, including the quality score according to the ISUOG subjective quality criteria, the zooming of the image inferred from the anatomical segmentation to total image ratio, and the confidence of the model’s prediction (Fig. [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig6)).

In every cine-loop, all standard biometry planes are detected, the relevant anatomical structures are segmented, then the quality criteria of each plane are assessed and the highest-scoring plane is selected. There is no quality assessment in the case of the AF volume assessment, the AF pocket with the larger depth is selected from the cine-loop.

The models were able to extract measurements from all the videos containing standard biometry planes. The 95% limits of agreement expressed in percentage using the Bland-Altman method were ±0.54% for HC, ±3.74% for BPD, ±0.14 % for AC, ±3.11% for FL, ±1.45% for GA, ±2.42% for EFW, and ±16.96 % for SDP. All percentages found are narrower than reported inter and intra-observer limits of agreements among sonographers (HC: ±3.0%, AC: ±5.3%, FL: ±6.6% for intra-observer difference, and HC: ±4.9%, AC: ±8.8%, FL: ±11.1 for inter-observer difference)[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR31) (Fig. [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig7)). Visual assessment of the Bland-Altman plots shows random error for every parameter, the variability increasing with the size of the parameter. However, our results also show constant bias for SDP and FL, the predicted measurements for both parameters being consistently greater than those of the physicians.

This over-expectation of the femur segmentation by the model can be mitigated by reviewing the images manually. By selecting images with abnormal results, we found that the model often selected planes showcasing strictly horizontal femurs and that the predicted calipers were placed to avoid the grand trochanter in accordance with measurement guidelines. Participating physicians did not always follow these guidelines (Fig. [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig8))[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR30).

The femur selected by the model (left) was strictly horizontal, abiding by the quality criteria, as opposed to the femur the physician selected (right). The AF pocket, correctly measured by the model (left), is larger than the one measured by the physician due to an error in caliper placement by the human operator.

As for the SDP discrepancy, it appears as though the model actually detected deeper pockets that were not selected or measured by the clinician. However, the model’s failure can also be explained by a slight angulation of the probe from 90° results in a larger anteroposterior pocket diameter at the time of examination which will be construed as the SDP by our approach (Fig. [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig8)).

The ICC for each measurement was high (>0.9 for all parameters apart from SDP), showing excellent reliability of the measurements: AC = 0.982, HC = 0.987, BPD = 0.975, FL = 0.945, GA = 0.978, EFW = 0.9713, SDP = 0.692.

The MAE for each biometric parameter was 0.67 ± 0.69 cm for HC, 0.33 ± 0.22 cm for BPD, 0.27 ± 0.40 cm for FL, 0.91 ± 0.81 cm for AC, 9.85 ± 14.36 days for GA, 147.18 ± 177.97 g for the EFW and 1.46 ± 1.10 cm for SDP (Table [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Tab2)).

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for each predicted biometric value, EFW, and GA compared to clinicians and state-of-the-art model FUVAI showing superior correct detection rates and lower MAE with our approach, except for the BPD measurement. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

The FUVAI model is the closest one to our approach for end-to-end automated biometric assessment from cine-loops and showed similar performances to those of trained sonographers[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR14) (see related methods for more comparisons with existing methods).

We computed the MAE of each parameter using the open-source FUVAI model developed by Płotka et al.[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR14) and compared them with our approach (Table [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Tab2)).

It showed inferior MAE compared with our approach for every biometric parameter except for BPD, we hypothesize that this is due to the fact that HC and BPD are measured from the same mask with our approach. However, it was often the case that operators took two distinct images to measure each, hence the difference in performance. We also note that our approach was able to correctly detect the entirety of the corresponding biometry plane while FUVAI failed to do so.

The MAE between the predicted SDP and the measured SDP was also lower than the one reported by Cho et al.[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR28) with their state-of-the-art model for AF pocket segmentation: AF-net (1.46 cm with our approach vs. 2.666 cm for Cho et al.[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR28) on a retrospectively annotated dataset).

There were no cases of oligohydramnios in the prospective set and 7 cases (7.07%) of polyhydramnios. The sensitivity and specificity of the models at detecting polyhydramnios were 86.6%, and 85.7%, respectively, when comparing them to the experts’ estimation.

The models’ estimated biometric parameters were computed during the prospective phase of the study at the earliest time after each examination was complete. No adverse effect was reported during the entirety of this study. Participants were not compensated for their participation in the study.

## Discussion

In this study, we were able to create a successful end-to-end method to automatically estimate FB and AFV from ultrasound cine-loops using the ISUOG quality criteria for standard biometry planes, with results that were similar to those of expert operators. These two tasks are part of the six fundamental items listed by the ISUOG in the recently updated practice guideline for the routine mid-trimester scan[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR31). They allow early detection of life-threatening conditions such as FGR, oligohydramnios, and polyhydramnios that are associated with increases in the risk of fetal mortality by respectively 19, 5, and 3 fold[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR32)– [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR34).

At present, sonographers must navigate through a series of steps to capture the correct anatomical plane. This involves adjusting the probe angle and position to meet the appropriate quality standards, freezing the image, and accurately positioning the calipers. This entire procedure, excluding the assessment of amniotic fluid volume, typically involves an average of 12 steps. The assessment of amniotic fluid volume adds additional steps, as it requires identifying the largest AF pocket, freezing the screen, and then positioning the calipers[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR31). The method we have developed simplifies this process significantly, enabling reliable biometric tasks to be performed by merely recording the relevant structures. This reduces the process to just three steps: initiating the recording, sweeping through the desired anatomical structure, and concluding the recording. If incorporated into the clinical workflow, this approach has the potential to decrease scanning time, alleviate the workload of sonographers, and ensure the optimal reliability of the measurements taken.

In addition to streamlining the fetal ultrasound, our approach has the potential to serve as an aid to the sonographer in training in the recognition of the quality criteria of each standard biometry plane and gaining independence in their practice.

If deployed in conditions where healthcare workers receive minimal ultrasound training, as is often the case in countries of the Global South, this approach has the potential to help patients receive accurate fetal biometry assessment, gestational age estimation, fetal weight estimation, as well as amniotic fluid volume assessment which in turn are key to diagnosing fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume abnormalities.

Indeed, the 95% limits of agreement expressed in percentage between the models’ measurements and the doctors’ measurements for AC, HC, FL, and SDP were narrower than both reported intra- and inter-observer variability for human expert sonographers[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR13), [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR35). The differences between the US machines, the operators, and the healthcare facilities in the retrospective and the prospective data indicate that the developed models are generalizable. Furthermore, our deterministic method has the advantage of always giving the same output given the same cine-loop, which is not the case for human operators. This means that AI can reliably assess fetal growth status and potentially detect AFV abnormalities on fetal US cine-loops automating the third of the six items showcased in the ISUOG guidelines; and having the potential to address the shortage of sonographers in countries of the Global South.

HC, BPD, AC, and FL have been shown to be more reliable and reproducible amongst expert operators than SDP measurement with intra and inter CC > 0.990 amongst expert sonographers and clinically acceptable 95% limits of agreement[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR35), [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR36). Our models showed intra CC superior to 0.94 for all the biometry metrics (AC = 0.982, HC = 0.987, BPD = 0.975, FL = 0.945) and reached narrower 95% limits of agreement than those reported in studies assessing their reliability and reproducibility between human sonographers.

The models we developed were specifically designed to extract the best biometric planes according to the ISUOG criteria. Although other models have been developed to automate quality control of 2D fetal ultrasound images through anatomical structure recognition, our study is the first to explicitly use the ISUOG quality criteria specifically for biometry plane classification[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR37), [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR38). Such an approach, if integrated into the clinical workflow, could be used to automate the biometry plane’s quality control. It could allow fast and inexpensive quality audits, accelerate the workflow of trained sonographers, and be a pedagogical tool to the sonographer in training. This could prove particularly useful in resource-stranded regions such as Africa, where only 38.3% of fetal US operators have received formal training, and only 40.4% of them have received a short theoretical course[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR3).

A similar study to ours compared the performances of a multi-task deep neural network (DNN) on FB assessment, testing it on 50 free-hand ultrasound videos with results comparable to those of trained sonographers. Our models outperformed the one described in the study (FUVAI)[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR14) when comparing the proximity of the results showcased by the model versus the sonographers expressed in MAE (Table [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Tab2)) even if the DICE score coefficients and IoU were lower for the same tasks, potentially indicating greater generalizability of our models. FUVAI’s choice of standard biometry planes didn’t rely on the quality of the plane but rather on the confidence of the model when selecting it; in other words, on how closely it resembled images from the training set, which are not necessarily the best standard planes according to the ISUOG guidelines.

Another vast prospective study by Pokaprakarn et al.[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR18) took an original approach and assessed the performance of a DNN to estimate GA from blind loops taken by non-trained operators. The DNN proved to be more accurate than expert sonographers at estimating GA with an MAE of 3.9 ± 0.12 days vs 9.85 ± 14.36 days with our approach, which could be a game changer in resource-stranded environments. A recent study using the same dataset from the Fetal Age and Machine Learning Initiative (FAMLI) developed a DL tool to assess fetal biometry and fetal presentation on mobile devices showing non-inferiority to trained sonographers performing the measurements (−1.4 ± 4.5 days)[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR20). These two studies manifest the potential of AI to be used in the clinical workflow to democratize access to quality fetal ultrasound worldwide. However, due to the nature of DNNs and the choice of blind sweeps, it is challenging to get a sense of how the model came up with its output, and impossible to extract AC or EFW for FGR risk assessment. Instead, our models mimic trained sonographers thanks to the separation of the FB workflow into classification, quality scoring, and segmentation tasks. They are thus understandable, with errors in the models’ outputs easily detectable by sonographers.

SDP estimation has the widest variability with reported inter-observer limits of agreement of −51% to +52% and an ICC of 0.42[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR13), [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR39). Our approach for AFV assessment is vastly more reliable, with limits of agreement of only ±16.96 % and an ICC of 0.692 for SDP measurement. This high variability amongst human operators might be explained by the “subjective” choice of the SDP. We brought the subjective choice closer to an objective one by segmenting and measuring every single AF pocket in a given cine-loop. In contrast, several studies present automated techniques to segment AF pockets and measure the pocket’s depth. Cho et al.[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR33), for example, developed a CNN showcasing results similar to those of sonographers in segmenting AF pockets (DICE similarity coefficient: 0.877 ± 0.086) and with an MAE of 2.666 ± 2.986 cm in the measurement of the pocket’s depth versus a DICE score of 0.783 in our study but an MAE of 1.46 ± 1.10 cm on prospectively acquired video loops. A second study by Sun et al.[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR40) complemented the work of Cho et al.[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR28) and developed a dual-path network approach to AF pocket segmentation to better account for reverberation artifacts in AF pockets, achieving a higher DICE similarity coefficient of 0.8599 ± 0.1074 on their dataset. However, both of these studies use 2D fixed images, only automating the segmentation part of the clinical workflow of AFV assessment. Ours proved to be clinically more precise and useful as they detected polyhydramnios with a sensitivity and specificity of 86.6%, and 85.7%, respectively.

As far as we are aware, our research is pioneering in its prospective evaluation of a model designed for estimating Amniotic Fluid Volume (AFV) using ultrasound videos. In practical application, healthcare professionals could verify the image chosen by the model, possibly rectifying any mistakes made either by themselves or the model, or they could browse through the selected pockets until they locate one that meets their satisfaction. Interestingly, this method could also be adapted for AFV evaluation from blind repeated craniocaudal perpendicular sweeps, thereby enabling even healthcare workers with minimal training to execute it.

A potential constraint of our methodology, stemming from the substantial size and computational demands of the models, is the requirement for an Internet connection for their deployment. This restricts their application to regions with Internet availability. Nonetheless, within the realm of telemedicine, Internet connectivity is typically a prerequisite, occasionally depending on a satellite link. Via telemedicine platforms, a proficient sonographer instructs an operator using a video stream of the ultrasound scan. Even under these circumstances, our automated technique can be employed to simplify the capture of ideal measurements and reduce the scan duration, thereby broadening access to quality imaging for prenatal care.

## Methods

In their comprehensive analysis of deep learning algorithms applied to fetal ultrasound-image examination, Fiorentino et al.[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR41) highlighted recent advancements in the use of these algorithms for identifying 2D fetal standard planes. Predominantly, the research focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for single-task operations, while some explored multi-task standard plane detection by identifying crucial anatomical structures. For instance, Baumgartner et al.[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR42) adapted the VGG16 architecture to detect 13 fetal standard planes, achieving a mean F1 score of 0.80 with their model, SonoNet. A few authors proposed multi-task models incorporating attention mechanisms for the detection of abdomen, head, and femur standard planes. Cai et al.[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR43), for example, trained a multi-task neural network with a temporal attention module and achieved F1 scores of 0.84, 0.89, and 0.81, respectively, on a test set of 280 videos lasting 3–7 s.

Fiorentino et al.[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR41) also reported on numerous research papers related to 2D fetal biometry estimation, with most focusing on a single structure, such as brain segmentation for HC measurement, abdomen segmentation for AC measurement, and femur segmentation for FL measurement. HC measurement has been the subject of intensive research due to the availability of the publicly annotated dataset HC18, despite the fact that the gold standard for GA and EFW formulae includes other biometric parameters such as AC and FL. Zeng et al.[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR15) proposed a modified version of V-Net that incorporates an attention mechanism and achieved a Dice score of 0.98 and an MAE of 1.95 mm. Similarly, Moccia et al.[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR26) adapted a Mask-R-CNN method and achieved comparable results with a Dice score of 0.98 and an MAE of 1.95 mm. Notably, only one study reported in the review used videos for the prospective evaluation of models for BPD and HC measurements[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR44). In contrast, very few papers have addressed abdomen and femur segmentation for AC and LF measurements, respectively. Using small datasets, Kim et al.[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR16) proposed an abdomen segmentation model that achieved a Dice score of 0.92, while Zhu et al.[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR45) proposed a femur segmentation model that achieved a Dice score of 0.92 and an MAE of 0.46 mm.

Most methods employed U-Net-based architectures, which are known for their semantic segmentation performance. However, Mask-R-CNN-based architectures were also utilized, as they allow for the segmentation of individual objects and the assessment of classification performance. Recently, some researchers have attempted a different approach, directly extrapolating measurements using regression models rather than running a segmentation model first and then approximating the measurement. To our knowledge, this approach has only been tested for HC estimation[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR46).

Very few papers have focused on multiple biometry estimation. To our knowledge, only one paper proposed a method for segmenting multiple anatomical structures for fetal biometry[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR14). The authors proposed the FUVAI model, which combined U-Net with ConvLSTM architectures and was trained on a large private dataset to estimate HC, AC, and FL measurements using 274,275 2D ultrasound images. The model was tested on 57,001 2D images and achieved a Dice score of 0.96 and an MAE of 2.5 mm.

For 2D amniotic fluid volume (AFV) assessment, Fiorentino et al. reported only three research papers[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR28), [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR40), [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR47). Using just 310 2D images, Cho et al. trained an adapted U-Net architecture called AF-Net and evaluated it on a test set of 125 2D images, achieving a Dice score of 0.87 and an MAE of 2.6 cm[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR28).

The use of different private datasets for evaluating these approaches, combined with the lack of public datasets, makes comparison challenging. All of the best performances were achieved using large, private datasets[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR42), [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR43), [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR48), [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR49), indicating that a data-centric approach leads to better generalization. However, very few studies have focused on multi-organ analysis and end-to-end pipelines, with a lack of interpretation of results. Most are retrospective “in silico” studies conducted on Caucasian populations. To our knowledge, no research has proposed end-to-end pipelines for multiple fetal biometry structure segmentation, standard plan classification, and quality criteria assessments following ISUOG guidelines. Furthermore, our AFV assessment outperforms state-of-the-art results and is the first to be integrated and validated with a prospective study from cine-loops designed for minimally trained healthcare workers. Additionally, no prior prospective study has aimed to automate FB and AFV assessment using a large dataset of 2D ultrasound images of African patients examined in low-resource settings (see supplementary information file for details).

### Models and training

In the training of the seven Mask-R-CNN models, we adopted an image-centric training procedure[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR12). Images were resized such that their scale (shorter edge) is 800 pixels[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR27). PyTorch (version 1.10) framework was used for model training, validation, and testing. The models were trained with 80% of the data, validated with 10%, and tested with 10%. We trained on the NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU for 2000 iterations, with a learning rate of 0.01 which was decreased by ten at the 500 iterations. We used a weight decay of 0.0001 and a momentum of 0.9. The used loss function is similar to the one described in Ref. [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR24). It combines the classification loss, the bounding-box loss, and the average binary cross-entropy loss of the mask.

In the training of the three classification models to infer the quality criteria of the abdomen and brain plans and to classify 11926 annotated images as containing AF pockets or not, the fully connected top layers were first replaced by an average pooling layer, then followed by a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function containing four outputs for the abdomen model, five outputs for the brain model and two outputs for the AF pocket model. TensorFlow (version 2.0) was used for model training, validation, and testing. We used 60% of the data for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The input images were resized to 224 × 224 pixels for the VGG16 model and to 299 × 299 for INCEPTIONV3 and RESNET50V2. For the brain and abdomen quality criteria classification, these images were first cropped based on their corresponding masks and then resized. The models were trained on the NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU until convergence over 100 epochs using a batch size of 32 and an initial learning rate of 10−3 that is reduced by a factor of 0.2 once learning stagnates. The training is stopped early when there is no improvement in the validation loss for the last 15 epochs, or when we reach 100 epochs. We use binary cross-entropy loss and Adam as the optimizer of Keras (version 2.3.1). To prevent overfitting, we apply, on the fly, various data augmentation techniques using the following transformations: rotation between −15 and 15 degrees, zoom by 10%, brightness range between 0.2 and 0.8, as well as horizontal and vertical flipping.

From the training results of all these models, we adopted the R\_50\_DC5\_3x model for the segmentation of the brain, abdomen, and femur, the INCEPTIONV3 models for the quality criteria classification and the AF pocket detection, and X\_101\_32x8d\_FPN\_3x model for the segmentation of AF pocket.

### Approximations of the biometric measurements

The biometric measurements are extracted from the output masks of the segmentation models. For the abdomen and brain, AC and HC are computed from the circumferences of the ellipses approximated by first, finding the contours and then direct least square fitting[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR42), [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR43). BPD is the minor axis of the brain ellipse. For the femur, FL represents the measure of the major axis of the extremities bounding box, and for the AF pocket, the SDP is the measure of the vertical axis of the bounding box. After the measurements are approximated in pixels, they are converted into centimeters using the DICOM’s pixel spacing tag (see supplementary information file for details).

### Study design

We validated the DL models on prospectively consecutively acquired transabdominal US videos from pregnant patients (>18 years, evolutive pregnancy >14 weeks, non-emergency related scan indication,) gathered at four healthcare centers in Morocco (Casablanca and Oujda) from October 2021 to April 2022 by 7 different radiologists and obstetricians (experience in fetal US > 10 years) and annotated during the examination using the machine’s ellipse and caliper facilities. The participating physicians were asked to measure HC, BPD, AC, and FL following the ISUOG criteria as well as the single deepest AF pocket (SDP) to assess AFV.

On top of their routine examination, the physicians had to take four additional cine-loops: three additional cine-loops containing all the standard biometry planes, and a cine-loop containing all AF pockets: an axial cephalic loop going from the base of the skull to the vertex, an axial abdominal loop going from the four-chamber view of the heart to a cross-section of the kidneys, a sagittal femur loop, and an amniotic loop sweeping perpendicularly through all the right, then the left AF pockets (Fig. [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#Fig1)).

The physicians had no knowledge of the predicted values for all biometric parameters until the end of the study, the team evaluating the models’ performances was also tasked to gather the prospective data and hence had access to the predicted and measured values for each. The biometric parameters were inferred by the models at the end of the study, seven months after its beginning. On the modeling side, the best segmentation and classification models that were trained on retrospective data were run on each video to extract HC, BPD, AC, or FL measurements depending on the plane. All the detected AF pockets on the “amniotic” cine-loops were segmented and their depth was computed, retaining the deepest one as the predicted SDP. This approach is directly inspired by the standard steps taken by expert-trained sonographers to select the single deepest pocket. They consist of the following tasks: (1) Sweep through all AF pockets, (2) Subjectively select the SDP, and (3) Measure the SDP’s depth. Oligohydramnios was defined as an SDP < 2 cm and polyhydramnios as an SDP > 8 cm[50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR50).

The primary outcomes were the models performances in fetal biometry and single deepest pocket measurements, expressed in mean absolute error, limits of agreement with the sonographers, and Intraclass correlation coefficients.

The secondary outcomes were the performances of the models at detecting AFV and fetal growth abnormalities (FGR) using sensitivity, and specificity metrics.

This study follows the STARD 2015 guidelines[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR51) as detailed in the supplementary information STARD checklist.

Approval for this study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of Oujda’s Faculty of Medicine (Comité d’Ethique pour la Recherche Biomédicale d’Oujda). Study participants provided their informed written consent and were not compensated for their participation to this study.

### Evaluation and statistical analysis

DICE score coefficients and Intersection of Union (IoU) were computed for the Mask-RCNNs on the retrospective dataset. For the classification tasks, the receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curves were computed.

The intended sample size was estimated at 122 patients with all corresponding measurements and cine-loops correctly performed (see supplementary information file: Sample Size Estimation, for more details). We computed the mean absolute errors (MAE) between the models’ measurements and the operators on the prospective cine-loops using the R package ‘Metrics’ (version 0.1.4) of R software (R version 4.2.1). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated using the Package ‘merTools’ (version 0.5.2). ICC is a desirable measure of reliability that reflects both the degree of correlation and agreement between measurements. Wilcoxon rank sum test was calculated for each measurement using the ‘PairedData’ (version 1.1.1) R package. We also compared the performance of our approach to the FUVAI[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10624828/#CR14) model using the percentage of correctly classified planes and MAE using the R package ‘Metrics’ (version 0.1.4). Bland-Altman plots were used for the visual assessment of the models’ reliability and the 95% limits of agreement were calculated and expressed in percentage using the ‘blandr’ package (version 0.5.1) of the R software. Firstly, The measurements from the operators and the model were passed to the blandr.statistics function to generate Bland-Altman statistics. After which, plots were generated using the package ggplot2 (version 3.3.6). Assessment of the models’ performances was carried out alongside prospective data collection.

## Continuing Education Activity

Sonographic evaluation of the amniotic fluid index (AFI) is a standardized and noninvasive method used during pregnancy to assess amniotic fluid volume, which is critical for fetal development and well-being. Amniotic fluid provides a protective environment, facilitates movement, supports temperature regulation, and contributes to the development of fetal organs such as the lungs. Additionally, the volume of amniotic fluid, produced and processed primarily by the fetus, reflects placental function. Measuring the AFI involves dividing the uterus into 4 quadrants and measuring the deepest vertical pocket of fluid in each quadrant, with these measurements combined to calculate the total AFI. A normal AFI ranges from 5 to 24 cm in singleton pregnancies, with deviations indicating oligohydramnios (low fluid) or polyhydramnios (excess fluid). An alternative evaluation method is the maximal vertical pocket (MVP) measurement, which is particularly useful in cases of multiple gestations or when AFI results are unclear.

Oligohydramnios, often caused by placental insufficiency or membrane rupture, can lead to complications such as pulmonary hypoplasia, fetal distress, and increased perinatal morbidity. Conversely, polyhydramnios, associated with conditions like maternal diabetes or fetal swallowing impairments, may result in preterm labor, macrosomia, or respiratory discomfort for the mother. Regular sonographic evaluation of amniotic fluid is integral to monitoring high-risk pregnancies, guiding clinical interventions, and ensuring optimal outcomes for both mother and fetus. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in appropriately performing sonographic techniques to evaluate amniotic fluid volume, interpreting evaluation findings, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional management approach to improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**

- Identify indications for sonographic evaluation of amniotic fluid volume.

- Apply appropriate ultrasound techniques to measure amniotic fluid volume.

- Implement applicable management approaches in a patient with various amniotic fluid parameters.

- Apply interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes in patients who undergo amniotic fluid evaluation.

## Introduction

Amniotic fluid is critical during pregnancy to provide a protective and nourishing environment for the developing fetus. It maintains a sterile space, regulates temperature, and cushions against external shocks. Amniotic fluid facilitates fetal movement, essential for musculoskeletal development, and supports the growth of organs, primarily the lungs. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[2\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The amount of amniotic fluid gradually increases until approximately 34 weeks gestation, after which it slightly decreases until 40 weeks and then declines more sharply after 42 weeks. [\[3\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

In the early stages of pregnancy, the composition of amniotic fluid resembles a complex dialysate derived from maternal serum. As the fetus grows, changes occur in the fluid's composition; notably, sodium concentration and osmolality decrease while urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels increase. [\[4\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[5\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Amniotic fluid also contains various steroid and protein hormones. [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[7\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Initially, it has little to no particulate matter, but by 16 weeks gestation, a significant number of cells shed from the amnion, skin, and tracheobronchial tree are present. These cells are crucial for antenatal diagnosis and serve as a source of DNA for karyotype analysis following amniocentesis. [\[8\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Typically, fetuses do not defecate during pregnancy; however, if under severe stress, they may pass meconium. This material contains bile pigments that can stain the amniotic fluid green, indicating fetal stress. [\[9\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The regulation of amniotic fluid volume (AFV) involves 3 primary mechanisms: placental control of water and solute transfer, fetal contributions through urine production and swallowing, and maternal factors affecting fluid balance.

Before 16 weeks of gestation, amniotic fluid is maintained primarily through intramembranous flow, transitioning to fetal urine production as the kidneys mature. The evaluation of amniotic fluid can be an indicator of fetal well-being. [\[10\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Maternal and placental factors, including serum osmolality, blood pressure, and placental vascularity, also influence AFV by modulating intramembranous flow. Conditions like maternal dehydration or altered placental function can disrupt this balance, leading to changes in amniotic fluid levels.

Clinical assessment of AF is essential to detect oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios, which can signal underlying fetal or maternal conditions. Ultrasound offers a rapid, noninvasive way to evaluate amniotic fluid. Some studies have noted that sonographic assessment of amniotic fluid may not be accurate compared to the more direct dye dilution method, as ultrasound measurements are less accurate in evaluating abnormal amniotic fluid volumes than normal volumes. [\[11\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) However, ultrasound offers a safe real-time option with comparable clinical outcomes. [\[13\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[14\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Sonographic assessment can be qualitative, visually assessing the volume ratio of amniotic fluid to the fetus and placenta, or semiquantitative. The 2 main methods for semiquantitative evaluation are the deepest vertical pocket (DVP) and the amniotic fluid index (AFI). Current guidelines recommend using DVP to diagnose oligohydramnios and AFI for polyhydramnios in singleton pregnancies, as studies indicate that these methods reduce the risk of overdiagnosis. For twin pregnancies, DVP is measured separately for each sac. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Therefore, a thorough understanding of amniotic fluid production, regulation, and assessment is crucial for optimizing maternal-fetal care, as abnormalities in AFV can have significant implications for perinatal outcomes.

## Anatomy and Physiology

**Amniotic fluid Physiology**

At the beginning of pregnancy, amniotic fluid is primarily a byproduct of maternal serum and resembles plasma due to hydrostatic and osmotic pressures. After 8 weeks of gestation, the fetal kidneys begin to function and produce urine; however, this does not become a key component of amniotic fluid until closer to 23 to 25 weeks, when fetal keratinization is complete. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) By the time keratinization is complete, fetal urinary production accounts for the most significant amount of amitotic fluid, with up to 1500 mL produced daily. [\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) In the last 20 weeks, fetal respiratory and gastric secretions also contribute up to 350 mL per day. Amniotic fluid is recycled primarily by fetal swallowing. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Additional recycling pathways include the intramembranous pathway of the placenta, umbilical cord, and fetal skin between the amniotic fluid and fetal blood (400 mL per day). [\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Amniotic fluid increases at a linear rate initially in the first half of pregnancy and continues to increase until the 36th or 38th week of pregnancy with an average maximal volume of 800 mL. [\[10\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Next, amniotic fluid can decrease by 8% per week, down to as low as 400 mL in gestation, near week 42. [\[10\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Under normal conditions, maternal serum remains near but slightly lower in osmolality to fetal serum, favoring flow to the fetus. Following fetal keratinization, amniotic fluid remains 10 Osm lower than fetal blood, allowing continuous flow through the placenta to the fetal blood. [\[10\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) In maternal dehydration, this balanced gradient between maternal and fetal serum can reverse, favoring flow out of the fetal circulation. Counter-regulation by continued flow into fetal circulation can decrease amniotic fluid volume when this occurs. These osmolarity gradient changes may explain why maternal hydration effectively reduces isolated uncomplicated oligohydramnios and why hyperglycemia often results in polyhydramnios. [\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The fetus can also affect the flow through these pathways due to the excretion of certain hormones, like growth factors and prolactin, which can alter membranes' permeability.

**Oligohydramnios**

Decreased fetal urine output can arise from several causes, which fall into 2 general categories—fetal urinary tract obstruction and decreased urine production by the fetal kidney. [\[16\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The inability to visualize any amniotic fluid is termed anhydramnios. Urinary tract obstruction can occur anywhere along the fetal urinary tract and can be catastrophic for the fetus. Decreased urine production by the fetal kidney typically reflects inadequate blood flow to the fetal kidney, caused by the shunting of fetal blood flow away from the kidney to the heart and brain. When the fetus receives insufficient nutrients and oxygen from the placenta, blood is redirected away from the fetal kidney, decreasing the glomerular filtration rate and reducing urinary output. Therefore, decreased amniotic fluid volume due to decreased urine production by the fetal kidney is a reflection of chronic hypoperfusion of the fetus. [\[17\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[18\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) This mechanism mirrors the cause of oliguria in critically ill adults. [\[19\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[20\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Another common cause of oligohydramnios is the rupture of the amniotic membrane, which allows amniotic fluid to leak out of the uterus. [\[21\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[22\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) can occur spontaneously or as a result of medical procedures (eg, amniocentesis). When PPROM occurs after 25 weeks, survival outcomes are more favorable, improving as gestational age advances, as the fetus has more time for normal lung development. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

**Polyhydramnios**

Polyhydramnios, or increased amniotic fluid volume, also has several potential causes, with 2 primary mechanisms—decreased fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid or increased fetal production of amniotic fluid. [\[23\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Polyhydramnios can cause overdistension of the gravid uterus, especially in cases where the fetus is normal size or large for dates. This overdistension increases the patient's risk for preterm contractions, preterm delivery, and premature rupture of membranes, in which the patient's water breaks before the onset of labor. Overdistension of the uterus is also a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage after delivery. [\[24\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[25\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

The normal fetus constantly swallows amniotic fluid and urinates to maintain the fluid level. If the fetus is unable to swallow the typical amounts of amniotic fluid, it can lead to polyhydramnios. This condition can occur due to gastrointestinal malformations, fetal neurological issues, eg, anencephaly, or mechanical obstruction of the esophagus by other intrathoracic processes. [\[23\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Increased production of amniotic fluid can occur due to fetal polyuria, often observed in cases of uncontrolled maternal diabetes with persistently elevated maternal blood sugar levels. In these cases, it may be associated with fetal macrosomia. Many cases of polyhydramnios are idiopathic, meaning no definite cause is identified. [\[26\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Indications

Amniotic fluid assessments are considered integral to the routine anatomic fetal evaluation, with derangements often found incidentally. Several professional society guidelines state that amniotic fluid assessment should be performed at all sonographic fetal evaluations. [\[27\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[18\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[27\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Specific high-risk factors in pregnancies have the potential to alter amniotic fluid dynamics and may warrant serial assessments. These high-risk factors include hypertension severe enough to require antihypertensives, pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders, fetal growth restriction, certain fetal anatomic anomalies, and late-term pregnancies. Additionally, when fundal size on a routine exam does not correlate with the gestational size, the amniotic fluid volume should be assessed. [\[28\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The assessment of amniotic fluid volume can also help rule out rupture of membranes and is included in the general assessment of fetal wellbeing as 1 of the 5 parts of the biophysical profile.

## Contraindications

Although diagnostic ultrasound is generally considered safe in pregnancy, ultrasound should only be performed when medically indicated. The concept of as-low-as-reasonably-achievable should be applied to reduce the overall thermal index exposed to the fetus. [\[29\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Doppler should not be used unless necessary due to the high-energy output of this technique. [\[30\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Equipment

Performing a diagnostics ultrasound in pregnancy requires real-time scanning. For subjective fluid measurement in the first trimester of pregnancy, intracavitary transducers may be used. Most amniotic fluid assessments will occur in the second and third trimester and utilize a transabdominal approach with a curvilinear transducer able to provide greater than 3 MHz. [\[29\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Technique or Treatment

**Amniotic Fluid Volume Assessment Techniques**

To assess amniotic fluid using sonography, the patient should be positioned supine, with the transducer held perpendicular to the floor, and aligned coronally to the patient. For the DVP, also referred to as the maximum vertical pocket (MVP), the entire uterus is scanned to identify the amniotic fluid pocket with the greatest vertical length. This pocket, which appears hypoechoic on ultrasound, is measured using vertical sonographic calipers. [\[31\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The measurement process must ensure that the calipers do not cross over fetal body parts or portions of the umbilical cord, as this could overestimate the pocket size. Pockets must be at least 1 cm wide to be considered valid, except for biophysical profiles, where a 2 cm width is required. [\[32\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[32\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

To calculate the AFI, the uterus is divided into 4 quadrants using the umbilicus as the central point. To ensure measurement consistency, the transducer should remain in an axial plane (notch toward the patient’s right). Each quadrant is systematically scanned to identify the largest vertical pocket of fluid, which is then measured with vertical calipers. The 4 measurements are added together to determine the total AFI. [\[33\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Color Doppler is recommended to confirm that the measured pockets are free of umbilical cord segments, which may not be visible on standard B-mode imaging. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[18\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[34\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

A DVP measurement is used for pregnancies <24 weeks or those with multiple gestations. [\[35\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The procedure is similar to that for AFI, but only a single DVP is identified and measured. A normal DVP ranges from 2 to 8 cm, with values <2 cm indicating oligohydramnios and >8 cm indicating polyhydramnios. [\[36\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[37\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Amniotic fluid measurements can vary due to intra-observer differences, maternal position, and hydration status. Maternal hydration, especially with simple hypotonic oral solutions, can improve the specificity of oligohydramnios diagnosis. [\[27\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[38\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Therefore, encouraging the patient to consume several liters of water before the evaluation may enhance accuracy. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[39\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

**Biophysical Profile**

Amniotic fluid volume is an essential component of the fetal biophysical profile, a specialized ultrasound technique used to assess fetal well-being. The biophysical profile has 4 sonographic components, each of which must be observed within 30 minutes of starting the ultrasound:

- Fetal breathing: Continuous movement of the fetal diaphragm for at least 30 seconds)

- Fetal movement: At least 3 discrete movements of the fetal body or limbs)

- Fetal tone: At least 1 active extension of a fetal limb with the return to flexion or opening and closing of the fetal hand

- Amniotic fluid volume: A single deepest pocket of at least 2 cm [\[40\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[41\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)


A fetal nonstress test measuring fetal heart rate tracing is also performed with the biophysical profile for a total of 5 components. [\[42\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

A healthy, term fetus that is not under physiological stress is expected to demonstrate all 4 of these behaviors on ultrasound. Preterm fetuses may not display all of these behaviors. Therefore, the management of pregnancies in which the fetus does not show all 4 behaviors described depends on the gestational age and the specific factors that are abnormal. [\[43\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Complications

Complications during the sonographic assessment of AFI or DVP are minimal. When performing the ultrasound, patients may experience discomfort with the pressure from the ultrasound probe or lightheadedness from the gravid uterus's compression on the vena cava in the supine position. A rolled towel under the patient’s flank to provide left lateral tilt may improve venous return and improve symptoms. [\[44\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Clinical Significance

**Interpretation of Abnormal Amniotic Fluid Measurements**

Normal reference ranges for the AFI vary depending on if the 5 to 95 or 3 to 97 percentiles are applied. For single gestations above 20 weeks, normal fluid is noted as an AFI between 5 to 24 cm, although some references prefer 25 cm as the upper limit. MVP in single-gestation pregnancies is considered normal when measured between 2 and 8 cm. It is important to note that only MVP is used to assess the amniotic fluid volumes in multi-gestation pregnancies. In a diamniotic pregnancy, the MVP is measured in each amniotic sac, allowing the clinician to attribute fluid to each fetus. Although the normal range for twins is closer to 2.2 to 7.5 cm, it is conventionally defined as between 2 to 8 cm. [\[31\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[45\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Oligohydramnios is diagnosed when amniotic fluid values fall below normal cut-offs. The list of potential causes is long and includes any condition causing uteroplacental insufficiency, anatomic issues with fetal urine production, and urinary tract obstructions. In severe cases, early pulmonary hypoplasia and limb disfigurement occur, resulting in significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. Even among structurally normal fetuses, oligohydramnios' mortality has been shown to have a 50-fold increase compared to a fetus with normal amniotic fluid measurements. [\[46\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Patients with oligohydramnios have several additional complications, including higher rates of intrauterine growth restriction, fetal distress on heart rate monitoring, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, low Apgar scores, and higher rates of cesarean section. [\[46\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[47\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[48\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[49\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

**Management of Abnormal Amniotic Fluid Volumes**

As a result of these complications, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends induction of pregnancy for isolated oligohydramnios between 36.0 and 37.6 weeks. [\[50\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Measurements must be obtained accurately, as these can lead to unnecessary intervention. Multiple studies have compared the use of the AFI with MVP for the diagnosis of oligohydramnios. Results indicate that AFI, compared to MVP, tends to overestimate clinically significant oligohydramnios and leads to overdiagnosis without improving maternal and perinatal outcomes. [\[35\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) [\[51\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Therefore, MVP is the preferred method for diagnosing oligohydramnios. [\[31\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

Polyhydramnios results from conditions in which there is increased production of amniotic fluid or decreased fetal swallowing. Causes of overproduction can include increased osmotic forces (eg, hyperglycemia or hydrops), cardiac dysfunction, infection leading to decreased fetal swallowing (occurs due to gastrointestinal tract obstruction), impaired neurological swallowing pathways, and some cranial facial abnormalities. The majority of cases are mild with no underlying etiology. As the severity of polyhydramnios increases, so does the incidence of fetal structural and genetic anomalies. Polyhydramnios can be graded in severity using the following thresholds for AFI or DVP:

- AFI


- Mild 24 to 29.9 cm

- Moderate 30 to 34.9 cm

- Severe ≥35 cm


- DVP


- Mild 8 to 11 cm

- Moderate 12 to 15 cm

- Severe: >16 cm [\[28\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)


Some evidence suggests that the MVP method may overestimate polyhydramnios, but more data is needed to confirm this hypothesis. [\[38\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Polyhydramnios has been shown to increase perinatal mortality to a lesser extent than oligohydramnios, with the rate dependent on the underlying cause. Perinatal morbidity associated with polyhydramnios includes an increase in preterm labor, macrosomia, nonvertex positions, nonreassuring fetal heart tracings, and cesarean delivery. [\[48\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) Polyhydramnios can cause significant discomfort to the mother as severe cases can impair adequate maternal respiration. In these cases, therapeutic amnioreduction may be considered. For most causes of mild polyhydramnios, ACOG currently recommends delivery between 39 and 39.6 weeks. [\[50\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

**Abnormal Amniotic Fluid Management in Multiple Gestations**

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome is a special case that warrants mentioning in the discussion of amniotic fluid derangement due to its simultaneous presentation of both polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios during the same pregnancy. This syndrome occurs in 10% to 15% of diamniotic-monochorionic twins due to shared chorionic vessels. [\[52\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#) The diagnosis requires a single placenta and the findings of oligohydramnios in 1 twin and polyhydramnios in the other. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome is often associated with hydrops of the twin with polyhydramnios and growth restriction of the twin with oligohydramnios. Due to significant associated maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity, current guidelines recommend screening starting at 16 weeks and continuing every 2 weeks until delivery to allow for early identification and treatment to guide delivery timelines. [\[52\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK570623/#)

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The assessment and management of amniotic fluid levels, including oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios, require a coordinated interprofessional approach to ensure optimal patient-centered care, safety, and outcomes. These conditions, which can have profound implications during pregnancy, demand heightened vigilance from healthcare team members. Physicians, including obstetricians, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and pediatric radiologists, play a pivotal role in performing and interpreting detailed anatomic ultrasounds to detect fetal anomalies commonly associated with abnormal amniotic fluid levels. Advanced practitioners, eg, nurse practitioners, must also be proficient in understanding and assessing the amniotic fluid index as part of the biophysical profile to monitor fetal well-being and identify potential complications.

Effective care requires robust interprofessional communication and collaboration. When abnormalities in amniotic fluid are suspected, referrals to obstetricians or maternal-fetal medicine specialists for advanced imaging and evaluation are critical. In cases of severe oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios, care coordination must include neonatal clinicians and personnel skilled in neonatal resuscitation, eg, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) trained nurses and specialized physicians, to manage potential complications during delivery. Delivery in a tertiary care facility is often necessary due to the higher likelihood of NICU admissions and postnatal anomalies.

The healthcare team’s responsibilities include ensuring patient safety and optimizing outcomes through comprehensive care coordination. This involves timely identification of at-risk pregnancies, appropriate referrals, and interdisciplinary discussions to develop individualized care plans. By fostering a team-based approach that integrates the expertise of physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, and other health professionals, the healthcare system can effectively address the complexities of amniotic fluid abnormalities. This collaboration enhances team performance and ensures that maternal and neonatal outcomes are prioritized throughout the continuum of care.

## Abstract

We aimed to study the association between three different methods of assessing the amount of amniotic fluid (subjective method (SM), deepest vertical pocket (DVP) and amniotic fluid index (AFI)) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) (in percentile or Z-score) after adjustment on maternal-fetal parameters. We performed a nationwide cross-sectional study through the French network of obstetric sonographers using the “flash” study method and including low-risk singleton pregnancies from 18–40 weeks. Crude and adjusted odds ratio were computed after stratification upon 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. 1667 ultrasound scans performed by 65 operators were included. Only Z-score of EFW was significantly associated with SM in both trimesters. For DVP and AFI, Z-score of EFW and male fetal gender was significantly associated with them in 2nd trimester. In the 3rd trimester, both Z-score of EFW and large (LGA) or small for gestational age (SGA) fetus were significantly associated with AFI. and DVP. Overweight woman and class I obesity women were also significantly associated with DVP modification. In conclusion, all three methods of amniotic fluid evaluation are significantly associated to estimated fetal weight. DVP and AFI appeared equivalent except that maternal-fetal factors seemed to have a higher impact in DVP than AFI.

## Introduction

The evaluation of amniotic fluid during a routine ultrasound scan can be performed in three ways: the subjective way, the measurement of the single deepest vertical pocket, or the evaluation of amniotic fluid index. The subjective method consists of visually estimating the amniotic fluid pockets during an ultrasound scan. The accuracy of this assessment will rely strongly on the experience of the sonographer[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR1 "Halperin, M. E., Fong, K. W., Zalev, A. H. & Goldsmith, C. H. Reliability of amniotic fluid volume estimation from ultrasonograms: intraobserver and interobserver variation before and after the establishment of criteria. Am J Obstet Gynecol 153, 264–267 (1985)."). The deepest vertical pocket evaluation consists of measuring the largest pocket free of fetal structures or cord with the ultrasound probe positioned parallel to sagittal plane[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR2 "Chamberlain, P. F., Manning, F. A., Morrison, I., Harman, C. R. & Lange, I. R. Ultrasound evaluation of amniotic fluid volume. I. The relationship of marginal and decreased amniotic fluid volumes to perinatal outcome. Am J Obstet Gynecol 150, 245–249 (1984)."), [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR3 "Chamberlain, P. F., Manning, F. A., Morrison, I., Harman, C. R. & Lange, I. R. Ultrasound evaluation of amniotic fluid volume. II. The relationship of increased amniotic fluid volume to perinatal outcome. Am J Obstet Gynecol 150, 250–254 (1984)."). The amniotic fluid index is the sum of the four largest vertical pockets of amniotic fluid, measured in each of the 4 uterus quadrants defined relative to the umbilicus[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR4 "Phelan, J. P., Ahn, M. O., Smith, C. V., Rutherford, S. E. & Anderson, E. Amniotic fluid index measurements during pregnancy. J Reprod Med 32, 601–604 (1987)."), [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR5 "Phelan, J. P., Smith, C. V., Broussard, P. & Small, M. Amniotic fluid volume assessment with the four-quadrant technique at 36–42 weeks’ gestation. J Reprod Med 32, 540–542 (1987)."). Several studies have reported that the amniotic fluid index was dependent on gestational age[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR6 "Moore, T. R. & Cayle, J. E. The amniotic fluid index in normal human pregnancy. Am J Obstet Gynecol 162, 1168–1173 (1990)."), [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR7 "Nwosu, E. C., Welch, C. R., Manasse, P. R. & Walkinshaw, S. A. Longitudinal assessment of amniotic fluid index. Br J Obstet Gynaecol 100, 816–819 (1993)."). Even though none of these methods is really satisfactory, discovering an abnormal amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy may change the perinatal care. In fact, finding a decrease amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy might be due to either a pathological situation such as preterm premature rupture of membranes or a malformation/dysfunction of the fetal urination, or might also be physiological, but needing ultrasound survey of the evolution.

Intuitively, many sonographers interpret the amount of amniotic fluid based on the estimation of fetal weight performed at the same time. It seems reassuring to have a more abundant amniotic fluid when the fetus has a greater weight. Indeed, fetal renal perfusion increases when increasing fetal weight[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR8 "Gilbert, W. M., Moore, T. R. & Brace, R. A. Amniotic fluid volume dynamics. Fet Med Rev. 3, 89–104 (1991)."). Therefore, we can assume that there might be a correlation or an association between fetal weight estimation and the quantity of amniotic fluid. Such an association could indicate that the amniotic fluid assessment should consider the fetal parameters to make it more precise. A review of the existing literature showed conflicting results on the possible correlation between the amount of amniotic fluid and fetal weight estimation[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR9 "Adeyekun, A.

However, these studies were all unicentric, based only on a small number of patients (from 90 to 400 patients), mainly retrospective and did not analyze the influence of other factors. Ultrasound scans were only performed during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and did not assess the single deepest vertical pocket method even though it has been demonstrated that this method was more reliable than the amniotic fluid index that would result in an increase in the false positive rate for a diagnosis of oligohydramnios[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR10 "Meyer, W. J. et al. Effect of amniotic fluid volume on ultrasonic fetal weight estimation. J Ultrasound Med 14, 193–197 (1995)."), [13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR13 "Magann, E.

Besides fetal parameters, maternal characteristics such as maternal age or body mass index may also influence the amount of amniotic fluid.

Given the aforementioned considerations, the objective of our study is to determine if there is an association between the different methods of assessing the amniotic fluid and the estimated fetal weight in crude and after adjustment on maternal or fetal characteristics.

## Material and Methods

### Study design

This study is a national prospective, multicentric, observational study, performed under the methodology of “Flash” studies[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR15 "Kuleva, M. et al. A standardized approach for the assessment of the lower uterine segment at first trimester by transvaginal ultrasound: a flash study.

Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,                      https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.17223                                         (2016)."). Flash studies are pragmatic, short and very focused studies conducted without modifying the routine clinical practice. They are conducted over the countrywide network of sonographers who are members of the French College of Fetal Ultrasound (CFEF - College Français d’Echographie Foetale). We invited sonographers first to take an online training course ( [www.cfef.org](http://www.cfef.org/)) reviewing the aims of the study, the inclusion criteria and the methodology. Only sonographers who completed the course and passed the final test were eligible to participate in the study. From February 2nd 2016 to February 15th 2016, sonographers were asked to assess during their routine ultrasound scan the amount of amniotic fluid according to the three methods (subjective/single deepest vertical pocket/amniotic fluid index). After receiving patient approval, the sonographer accessed, through his/her personal login codes, to a patient’s individual electronic file report on the CFEF website, dedicated to the study, and with which he/she fulfilled patient data. Each pregnant woman contributed to the study with a single ultrasound scan and was prospectively and consecutively included over time. Pregnancy dating was based on the crown-rump length measurement in the first trimester, as recommended by the French College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (CNGOF)[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR18 "Papageorghiou, A. T. et al. International standards for early fetal size and pregnancy dating based on ultrasound measurement of crown-rump length in the first trimester of pregnancy.

### Population

Inclusion criteria were: women over 18 years, carrying a singleton pregnancy without congenital malformation at a gestational age from 18 weeks to 40 weeks of gestation, with an uncomplicated pregnancy and who consent to participate in the study. Non-inclusion criteria were the existence of a pregnancy complication listed below: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (which includes gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and eclampsia), gestational diabetes, stillbirth, cholestasis and threatened preterm labor. Gestational hypertension was defined by a systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher on two separate occasions after 20 weeks of gestation in the absence of proteinuria. Preeclampsia was defined as gestational hypertension with either proteinuria 300 mg or more in a 24-hour sample or, if a 24-hour sample was not available, 2+ or higher on dipstick testing, or a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of 0.03 g/mmol or more.[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR20 "Al, R.

Gestational diabetes was defined by one abnormal value on the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test according to thresholds from the HAPO study (fasting ≥ 5.1 mmol/l, 1 hour ≥ 10.0 mmol/l, 2 hours ≥ 8.5 mmol/l)[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR23 "College.national.des.gynecologues.et.obstetriciens.francais. Gestational diabetes. J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris) 39, S139, S338–142 (2010)."). Cholestasis was defined as symptoms of pruritus that typically include the palms and soles, as well as elevated bile acid levels[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR24 "Williamson, C. & Geenes, V.

The sonographer should collect the following information: maternal age, parity, gravidity, Body mass Index (BMI) before pregnancy (defined as weight in kg/(height in meter)[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR2 "Chamberlain, P.

Estimated fetal weight (EFW) was obtained with the 4 parameters Hadlock formula[28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR28 "Hadlock, F. P., Harrist, R. B., Sharman, R. S., Deter, R. L. & Park, S. K. Estimation of fetal weight with the use of head, body, and femur measurements–a prospective study.

Regarding amniotic fluid evaluation, the sonographer began with the subjective method (SM) consisting in visually estimate the amniotic fluid pockets during the ultrasound scan. We asked the sonographer to report and classify the findings it in three way: oligohydramnios, normal, polyhydramnios. Then, deepest vertical pocket (DVP) evaluation was performed, consisting in measuring vertically the largest pocket free of fetal structures or cord with the ultrasound probe positioned parallel to sagittal plane[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR2 "Chamberlain, P.

Ultrasound evaluation of amniotic fluid volume. II. The relationship of increased amniotic fluid volume to perinatal outcome. Am J Obstet Gynecol 150, 250–254 (1984)."). This measurement was expressed in centimeters. Finally, the sonographer performed the amniotic fluid index (AFI) evaluation which is the sum (in centimeters) of the four largest vertical pockets of amniotic fluid, measured in each of the 4 uterus quadrants defined relative to the umbilicus and free of fetal structures or cord[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR4 "Phelan, J.

Non-inclusion criteria were multiple pregnancies, maternal chronic pathology and fetal malformation. Small for gestational age or macrosomic fetuses were not excluded and participated in the study. All these prospectively collected measurements constituted our primary database. According to French law in the context of observational studies, obtaining the written consent of the patient was not necessary. Every patient had been informed of the study by the sonographer and by a newsletter. The patient’s data may be included in the study if they did not object to their anonymous use. This study received approval by the French ethics committee under the notification number 2016/71.

### Statistical analysis

Quantitative variables were described in the study population with means and standard deviations (SD) or median and interquartiles (Q25-Q75) depending on the distribution tested with the Shapiro-Wilk statistic. For categorical variables, the comparisons of percentage were made with chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test if chi-square was not valid. Normality distribution of variables was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q plot method (supplementary materials). According to the normality of the distributions, comparisons of means between groups were performed using Student test or Mann Whitney rank sum test.

To evaluate the relationship between DVP or AFI and different maternal-fetal parameters, univariate and multivariate analysis using linear regression models were performed. Studied parameters were maternal age, BMI, fetal sex, tobacco use, nulliparity, nulligravidity and EFW. For the dependant variable SM, a logistic regression was performed and the Odds-ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were reported. The variables included in the logistic or linear models were variables, which have been shown previously to be associated with studied dependent variable (SM, DVP or AFI). The α-to-enter in the model was set at 0.20. The EFW, the maternal age and the BMI before pregnancy were included in all models. The EFW was modelled either in percentile in three categories (<10th percentile or small for gestational age (SGA); 10–90th percentile or normally grown foetuses and; >90th or large for gestational age (LGA)), or in Z-score according to gestational age[28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR28 "Hadlock, F.

## Results

During the two-week period, 1667 ultrasound scans were performed by 65 operators and included in the study. Mean maternal age was 31.6 years+/− 5.0 (range 18–46 years) and mean BMI at the beginning of pregnancy was 25.3 kg/m2+/− 4.9 (range 16.1–55.2). Distribution of BMI was as followed: <18.5 kg/m2 (2.5%), 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 (54%), 25–29.9 kg/m2 (28.4%), 30–35 kg/m2 (10.5%), >35 kg/m2 (4.6%). Thirty-eight percent of women were experiencing their first pregnancy, 47% were nulliparous, and 10.4% continued to smoke during their pregnancy. Ultrasound scan were performed at every gestational age from 18 to 40 weeks of gestation but more often at key gestational age corresponding to usual timing of French routine ultrasound: 1.5% under 21 weeks, 35% from 21–23 weeks, 13% from 24–30 weeks, 38.5% from 31–33 weeks, 7% from 34–36 weeks and 5% at term (37–40 weeks). Fetuses were female in 50%, male in 45% and undetermined or non-reported in 5%. EFW mean was 1,397.9 g +/−840.5 (range 209–5,119). The graph showing the distribution of EFW (median, 5th and 95th percentile) according to gestational age (in weeks) is presented in Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig1).

Due to the bimodal distribution of our data, grouped around second and third trimester of pregnancy corresponding to usual timing of French routine ultrasound, were decided to split our data in two. Second trimester corresponded to data ranging from 18 to 28 weeks and 6 days (n = 787); Third trimester corresponding to data from 29–40 weeks (n = 880).

Global amniotic fluid subjective evaluation (SM) classification was as followed: oligohydramnios (5.3%), normal fluid (86.8%) and polyhydramnios (7.9%) respectively. Distribution of oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios significantly differed from 2nd versus 3rd trimester, with 1.9% and 7% versus 9.2% and 9% respectively (p < 0.001). When analyzing SM categories according to EFW categories, oligohydramnios were more prevalent in the SGA category with 19.4% (versus 4.5% for normally grown fetuses and 1.4% for LGA) whereas polyhydramnios were more frequent in the LGA group with 10.8% (versus 5.4% for SGA and 7.9% for normally grown fetuses) (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis of the association between SM and EFW differed according to 2nd or 3rd trimester and according to EFW modeling. When EFW was modeled in z-score, SM classes was significantly associated with EFW, both in 2nd and 3rd trimester with p = 0.005 and p < 0.0001 respectively. When EFW was modeled in percentile (3 categories), SM classes was not significantly associated with EFW in the 2nd trimester (p = 0.42), but remained significant in the 3rd trimester (p < 0.0001). The distributions of EFW according to 2nd and 3rd trimester in each SM category are presented in Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig2).

Distribution of deepest vertical pocket (DVP) and amniotic fluid index (AFI) according to EFW and stratified by trimester are presented in Figs [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig3) and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig4) showing the bimodal distribution. In the Figs [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig5) and [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Fig6), distribution of DVP and AFI was also presented according to EFW in centiles in order to control for gestation (with lines represeting median, 5th and 95th percentile). Presenting the density of DVP and AFI (supplementary materials) in histograms, stratified by trimester, showed a Gaussian appearance of the data, without statistical confirmation of the normality of the distribution (Shapiro Wilk test; p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001 respectively). However, due to the Gaussian appearance of the distribution, to the high number of observations and finally to the Q-Q plot analysis (supplementary materials) the hypothesis of normality of the data has been preserved. Univariate analysis of the association between DVP and EFW differed according to 2nd or 3rd trimester and according to EFW modeling. When EFW was modeled in z-score, DVP was significantly associated with EFW, both in 2nd and 3rd trimester with p = 0.02 and p < 0.0001 respectively. When EFW was modeled in percentile (3 categories), DVP was not significantly associated in the 2nd trimester (p = 0.07), but remained significant in the 3rd trimester (p < 0.001). As for SM and DVP, univariate analysis of the association between AFI and EFW differed according to 2nd or 3rd trimester and according to EFW modeling. When EFW was modeled in z-score, AFI was significantly associated with EFW, both in 2nd and 3rd trimester with p = 0.002 and p < 0.0001 respectively. When EFW was modeled in percentile (3 categories), AFI was not significantly associated with EFW in the 2nd trimester (p = 0.06), but remained significant in the 3rd trimester (p < 0.001).

For SM evaluation, when using EFW percentile categories, no variable tested was associated with an oligohydramnios or a polyhydramnios in the 2nd trimester (Table [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Tab1)). Some variables (such as BMI < 18.5, or EFW > 90th percentile in case of oligohydramnios) were so scarce that logistic regression modeled was not able to compute precise value for odds ratio (OR). In the 3rd trimester, oligohydramnios found by SM method was significantly associated with SGA fetuses (p < 0.0001) whereas polyhydramnios found by SM was not associated with any variable including EFW in percentile (Table [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#Tab2)). When switching EFW modeling into Z-score in the logistic model, oligohydramnios found by SM at 2nd or 3rd trimester was significantly associated with decreasing Z-score (p < 0.03 and p < 0.001); whereas polyhydramnios found by SM remained significant only in the 2nd trimester with increasing Z-score (p = 0.047).

An increase in DVP was found to be, in the 2nd trimester, associated with an increase in maternal age (p = 0.05) and fetal male sex (p = 0.023) but not with EFW in percentile (p = 0.13); whereas in the 3rd trimester, increasing DVP was associated strongly with EFW in percentile (more LGA and less SGA) (p < 0.0001) and BMI (overweight women and class 1 obesity) (p = 0.03). When using Z-scores of EFW, increasing DVP remained significantly associated with increasing Z-score of EFW regardless of the trimester (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001 respectively).

Finally, an increase in AFI in the 2nd trimester, was associated only with fetal male sex (p = 0.006), but not with EFW in percentile (neither SGA nor LGA) (p = 0.3); whereas in the 3rd trimester, EFW in percentile alone (more LGA and less SGA) was strongly associated with an increase in AFI (p < 0.0001). With the use of Z-scores of EFW, as for DVP, increasing AFI remained significantly associated with increasing Z-score of EFW regardless of the trimester (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001 respectively).

## Discussion

### Main Findings

Based on large population of patients scanned during a short period of time and at various gestational ages, this study showed that all three methods of amniotic fluid evaluation are significantly associated to estimated fetal weight. Other factors such as fetal male gender or maternal BMI (overweight and class I obesity) may also have an impact on the amount of amniotic fluid. SM was the method that was least often associated with estimated fetal weight especially in case of polyhydramnios showing its strong dependence to operator’s experience. DVP and AFI appeared equivalent except that maternal-fetal factors seemed to have a higher impact in DVP than AFI.

### Interpretation

To evaluate the association between amniotic fluid measurement and fetal biometry, we asked the sonographer to perform all three existing methods. We found a significant association between every method and EFW but with a different strength according to trimester stratification and EFW modeling methods. We know, from a statistical point of view that, according to the modeling method used for a continuous parameter, the results in term of significance could vary. Using Z-score of EFW in the regression model gives the advantage of having a boundless normally distributed variable with a lot of information, but less easy to interpret from a clinical point of view. On the opposite, using EFW percentile categories (SGA, normal, LGA) creates a loss of statistical information but increases the easiness of clinical interpretation. Therefore, for the second trimester analysis, where the number of SGA and LGA is small compared to third trimester, using EFW in percentile gives less significant results than Z-scores.

In France, AFI still remain a popular method and largely performed even though it has been demonstrated that DVP evaluation was more reliable[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR10 "Meyer, W.

J Ultrasound Med 30, 1573–1585 (2011)."), the use of AFI would result in an increase in the false positive rate for a diagnosis of oligohydramnios, in comparison with the single deepest vertical pocket method. In contrast, Kofinas _et al_. found that AFI was correlated to EFW percentile in the third trimester of pregnancy regardless of mother diabetic status[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR33 "Kofinas, A. & Kofinas, G. Differences in amniotic fluid patterns and fetal biometric parameters in third trimester pregnancies with and without diabetes. J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med 19, 633–638,                      https://doi.org/10.1080/14767050600822547                                         (2006)."). Although no explanation has been given for pregnancies in non-diabetic patients, it has been postulated that pregnant fetuses of diabetic patients spend more time breathing than swallowing; and it is not possible to breathe and swallow at the same time. Then, the authors postulated that fetuses of diabetic patients swallow less fluid than normal. Thus, in diabetic pregnancies, it may be necessary to consider the EFW of the fetus when interpreting variations of amniotic fluid across gestational ages. However, this study does not indicate whether this correlation is strong enough to be considered and applied clinically. In our study, the goal was not compare directly the performance of one method to another. This has been previously performed and DVP seems to be more reliable, more representative of real amniotic fluid volume and the only method associated with a reduction rate of unnecessary induction of labor and of cesarean delivery for fetal distress[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR34 "Nabhan, A. F. & Abdelmoula, Y. A. Amniotic fluid index versus single deepest vertical pocket as a screening test for preventing adverse pregnancy outcome. Cochrane Database Syst Rev, CD006593,                      https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006593.pub2                                         (2008)."). In our study, based in a population free from gestational diabetes, DVP and AFI were both influenced by EFW. We confirmed Kofinas’ findings and we also found the same association with DVP in 3rd trimester.

The least often association for SM with EFW could rely on the fact that only trained sonographer, are able to appropriately use this method. Besides, SM evaluation is not designed to accurately discriminate small variation of fetal weight and therefore is not appropriate when searching for that kind of association. In that situation, it fails to be strongly associated to parameters, due to the structure of this variable (categorical). It is more used to rapidly interpret the amount of amniotic fluid and needs to be confirmed by a precise measurement in case of suspected oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios.

Results of significant association between DVP/AFI and EFW confirmed our preliminary hypotheses. In the absence of maternal metabolic disease, fetuses with increased EFW would have had an increased DVP or AFI value. However, this association even statistically significant is not unique and other factors (male fetus, BMI, maternal age) also have an impact in the variation of the amount of amniotic fluid. This may be explained by the fact that fetal swallowing and fluid reabsorption by the mother are capable of maintaining an approximately stable amount of fluid irrespective of the amount of fetal urine produced. It can also be assumed that fetal urine production is finally only slightly influenced by the weight of the fetus. Previous studies by Adeyekun _et al_.[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR9 "Adeyekun, A. A. & Awosanya, G. G.

However, these studies did not investigate association by using DVP, and we can assume that the number of patients was not sufficient to demonstrate a significant association. Despite the recognized limitations of the ultrasound measurement of the AFI and DVP, these measures remain an important component of antenatal fetal assessment when combined with other biophysical parameters. Therefore, it seems wise to continue to consider the variation of the AFI or DVP rather than SM alone.

Some adjustment on specific variable retrieved interesting results. Tobacco smoking, nulliparity and nulligravidity, even associated with a p value less than 0.2 for some univariate analysis, ever reached significance in the multivariate analysis. Compared to national French perinatal data[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR35 "Blondel, B. et al. Trends in perinatal health in metropolitan France from 1995 to 2016: Results from the French National Perinatal Surveys. J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod 46, 701–713,                      https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogoh.2017.09.002                                         (2017)."), the patients in our sample were older (31.6 years versus 30.3 years), had a higher BMI (overweight, class I and II/III obesity: 28.4%, 10.5%, 4.6% versus 20.2%, 8.1% and 3.7% respectively), smoked less tobacco (10.4% versus 16.6%) and were more often nulliparous (46.8% versus 42.2%). Therefore, our “low risk population” according to the study design might be slightly at higher risk than expected. However, we believe that non-significance of the aforementioned variables might be probably due to the strong impact of some variables such as EFW in the model.

A significant impact of BMI was observed for DVP assessed in the overweight and class I obesity group. In obese or overweight patients, literature has shown that the risk of macrosomia was strongly increased (OR 1.7–2.4) independently of the presence of gestational diabetes[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR36 "Weiss, J. L. et al. Obesity, obstetric complications and cesarean delivery rate–a population-based screening study. Am J Obstet Gynecol 190, 1091–1097,                      https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2003.09.058                                         (2004)."). We could assume that increasing BMI is associated with increased EFW also associated with increased amniotic fluid volume. But, as an adjustment on EFW was performed, another possible assumption is that obese women do have a bigger placenta that produces higher amniotic fluid volume than smaller ones. The fact that this association was only observed with DVP and not AFI could be related to more difficult ultrasound examination in obese than in normal BMI patients[37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR37 "Fuchs, F. et al. Factors affecting feasibility and quality of second-trimester ultrasound scans in obese pregnant women. Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 41, 40–46,                      https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.12311                                         (2013)."). The margins of error in the measures for the calculation of AFI may be greater, explaining why the association is not detected with that method.

Perni _et al_.[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR12 "Perni, S. C., Predanic, M., Cho, J. E., Kalish, R. B. & Chasen, S. T. Association of amniotic fluid index with estimated fetal weight. J Ultrasound Med 23, 1449–1452; quiz 1453 (2004).") found, in the third trimester of pregnancy, a significant correlation between EFW and AFI only in female fetuses (p < 0.001; r = 0.31). The correlation was significant for both fetal genders only after 38 weeks of gestation (p = 0.03 and r = 0.30). These results are not consistent with our results since we found an association between male fetus and DVP or AFI in the second trimester. Again, as for BMI, male fetuses are bigger than girl and therefore produce higher amount of amniotic fluid. But, as an adjustment on EFW was performed, we could then only assume that fetal urine production is probably higher in male fetus.

### Strengths and Limitations

Several strengths of our study should be mentioned. This is a large prospective multicentre study with experienced sonographers evaluating all the three methods of amniotic fluid evaluation when other studies mainly focused on AFI. Sonographers participating in the study had first to take an online training course reviewing the aims of the study, the inclusion criteria and the methodology to assess the amniotic fluid through the three methods, in order to reduce inter-observer variability. Only sonographers who completed the course and passed the final test were eligible to participate in the study. The large number of ultrasound scans performed in this study (1667 scans) enables us to produce precise and robust evaluation of associations. It gave us the power to observe relationship between parameters that were in other studies not visible due to the lack of power. Moreover, we studied the association over a long period of pregnancy ranging from 18 to 40 weeks to cover the maximum pregnancy time, unlike the other studies that were mainly limited to the third trimester of pregnancy. Several papers have examined the volume of amniotic fluid by gestational age, but with ultrasound data coming from a few hundred patients. Magann _et al_.[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25497-3#ref-CR14 "Magann, E. F., Sandlin, A. T. & Ounpraseuth, S. T. Amniotic fluid and the clinical relevance of the sonographically estimated amniotic fluid volume: oligohydramnios. J Ultrasound Med 30, 1573–1585 (2011)."), for example, published percentile curves for DVP and AFI as a function of gestational age with data from 291 patients. Because of the large number of patients included in our study, we believe that these measurements can become a good database and can be used, later, to create new AFI and DVP percentile curves according to gestational age. However, a selection of very low risk patients with an EFW ranging from 10 to 90th percentile would be the first step of this study. Then, it would be interesting to compare these curves with other curves published in the literature.

Some weakness may also be mentioned. Quantitative assessment methods such as DVP and AFI have the theoretical advantage of being reproducible and comparative. However, the measures themselves and the choice of the tank are largely subjective and vary greatly from one observer to another. We still often find, for the same pregnancies at the same term, with great disparities in the values of AFI or DVP in particular according to the observers. Despite the precautions taken to prevent this inter-observer variability in the measurement of biometrics and the quantity of liquid, it will remain the main bias in our study because there were 65 different sonographers. This variability is inescapable but it shows the real life. Another limitation relies on the absence of flow chart. We do not have any information regarding the number and the characteristics of the patient that refused to be included in the study. We agree with the fact that it could have created a selection bias if many of potentially includable patients were not included. However, due to the high number of women included by a restricted number of sonographer during a very short period of time, we believe that the number of patient missed to be included is relatively low. Another limitation relies on the lack of information at birth for the fetus included. In fact, as the goal of this study was only to answer the question of a sonographic association at a precise point of time, we do not have the longitudinal follow up of those pregnancies and therefore we do not have any other information on birthweight. This could have created a classification bias if we consider that the informations provided by the sonographer were wrong. Finally we were not able to compare the three methods in order to find the best one; but this was not the aim of our study.

In conclusion, our study, based on a large amount of data obtained during a short period of time, demonstrates that every method for assessing amniotic fluid estimation was associated with estimated fetal weight with more accurate precision at the third trimester.

## Abstract

Amniotic fluid assessment is vital to fetal well-being. Accurately diagnosing an amniotic fluid abnormality can aid in the proper management of a pregnancy at risk for an adverse outcome. Sonography is the most common way to assess amniotic fluid volume throughout a pregnancy; however, the most accurate technique, amniotic fluid index or maximum vertical pocket, is yet to be determined. Dye-dilution techniques are the most accurate way to measure amniotic fluid volume, but they are invasive and can be performed only at the time of a cesarean delivery. Multiple studies have been performed to determine the accuracy of the amniotic fluid index and maximum vertical pocket methods when diagnosing amniotic fluid volume abnormalities. Based on the studies reviewed in this article, neither method stands out as superior to the other when it comes to diagnosing amniotic fluid abnormalities during pregnancy. However, the maximum vertical pocket should also always be considered when an amniotic fluid abnormality is suspected because the amniotic fluid index overdiagnoses amniotic fluid abnormalities, leading to increased rates of pregnancy intervention and the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

## Introduction

Amniotic fluid is vital for fetal well-being and pregnancy outcome. It delivers an ideal environment for normal fetal growth and development by providing the fetus with a source of water, protecting the fetus from trauma, allowing for normal movements critical for anatomic development, and contributing to the improvement of fetal lung maturity.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) The amount of amniotic fluid at any given gestational age is critical to fetal progress and can ultimately affect the end result of a pregnancy. The normal amount of amniotic fluid volume (AFV) across a gestation has not been clearly defined, and consequently, abnormal values are also poorly defined.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) There are numerous methods that can be used to evaluate AFV during pregnancy; however, the most accurate method is yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid volume assessment is now recognized as an indispensable adjunct to antenatal fetal assessment; therefore, it is crucial that a standard method be determined to prevent fetal morbidity and mortality as well as other adverse pregnancy outcomes when AFV abnormalities are diagnosed.[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269) The purpose of this review is to determine an accurate method for determining AFV abnormalities by evaluating several published studies that have compared sonographic methods of assessing AFV during pregnancy.

## Sources Affecting AFV

Before classifying AFV as normal or abnormal, it is imperative to understand where amniotic fluid comes from and why it is essential to maintain an ordinary healthy pregnancy. There are many factors, both fetal and maternal, that affect the AFV throughout a gestation. Amniotic fluid is maintained in a dynamic equilibrium; its volume is the sum of fluid (from fetal urine and lung fluid) flowing into and out of the amniotic space.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269) There is an active balance between fetal urine production and fetal swallowing that seems to control the net AFV, unless there is a fetal anomaly affecting those functions. Fetal swallowing can be affected by structural abnormalities such as esophageal atresia; cleft lip and palate; congenital abnormalities including Trisomy 13, 18, and 21; decreased amniotic osmolality; and increased fetal plasma osmolality.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269), [2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269), [4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr4-8756479316687269) Abnormalities with fetal swallowing often lead to polyhydramnios, or an abnormal increase in AFV.[4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr4-8756479316687269) Other etiologies related to polyhydramnios include maternal conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes and drug exposure as well as fetal causes such as macrosomia; congenital infections; fetal tumors; central nervous system anomalies such as anencephaly and spina bifida; gastrointestinal anomalies; and abnormalities of the respiratory system and genitourinary system.[4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr4-8756479316687269), [5](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr5-8756479316687269) Whereas fetal and maternal conditions are seen in nearly half of all cases of polyhydramnios, the remaining half have no apparent cause and the abnormal AFV remains unexplained.[4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr4-8756479316687269), [5](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr5-8756479316687269) In idiopathic polyhydramnios, there is a 2- to 5-fold increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality as well as an increased risk of abnormal presentation and cesarean delivery.[4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr4-8756479316687269)

Fetal urine production is the principal factor that affects AFV during pregnancy. Fetal urine first enters the amniotic space at 8 to 11 weeks of gestation and is the predominant source of amniotic fluid in the second half of the pregnancy.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) Lack of fetal urine production often leads to oligohydramnios, or a decreased AFV. Genitourinary abnormalities, such as bladder outlet obstruction, posterior urethral valves, and Potter’s syndrome, as well as congenital abnormalities can cause oligohydramnios. Other pathologies related to decreased AFV include premature rupture of membranes, placental dysfunction, intrauterine growth restriction, postdate pregnancy, and uteroplacental insufficiency from maternal or fetal complications such as hypertension, diabetes, and placental abruption.[6](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr6-8756479316687269), [7](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr7-8756479316687269)

Other factors affecting AFV throughout pregnancy include the secretion of fetal lung fluid and the intramembranous movement of water and solutes into fetal circulation.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) The intramembranous pathway is a mechanism that the body uses to maintain the balance of AFV as a pregnancy progresses. As gestation advances, fetal urine production increases, as does the amount of lung fluid secreted by the fetus, which can cause a rise in AFV. The intramembranous pathway is the body’s natural way of maintaining normal AFV by compensating for the excess fluid that the fetus is producing.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) Maternal hydration also plays a role in overall AFV at any given point during gestation. The intramembranous pathway likely plays a role in correcting the fluid volume during times of maternal dehydration.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) Magann et al.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) performed a study, finding that using 1 liter of intravenous hydration in a dehydrated mother increased the actual and sonographically estimated AFV in the fetus.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) Kilpatrick et al.[8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr8-8756479316687269) confirmed these findings and found that maternal hydration with 2 liters of fluid in a mother with low AFV can increase the human fetal amniotic fluid index (AFI) by up to 31%.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) In a normal singleton pregnancy, AFV rises progressively until approximately 33 weeks of gestation and then plateaus between 33 and 38 weeks, which is then followed by a decline after 38 weeks.[4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr4-8756479316687269)

## Methods

Diagnosing any AFV abnormality prenatally is crucial to properly managing a pregnancy in order to decrease the risk of fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269) There are multiple techniques that can be used to assess AFV during pregnancy. The most accurate, yet most invasive and impractical method for determining AFV is obtaining direct measurements at the time of hysterotomy with the use of dye-dilution techniques.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269), [4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr4-8756479316687269), [8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr8-8756479316687269) The problem with this method is that it is intrusive, cumbersome, and time consuming; requires laboratory support; and cannot be used to assess amniotic fluid levels throughout the pregnancy.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269), [8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr8-8756479316687269) Another limitation is that the direct measurement obtained using the dye-dilution technique reflects AFV only at the time of cesarean delivery.[8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr8-8756479316687269) Because of the bounds of the dye-dilution technique, sonography is used to measure AFV at any given point throughout gestation.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269)

The AFI method, first introduced by Phelan et al. in 1987,[10](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr10-8756479316687269) involves dividing the amniotic cavity into four quadrants and measuring the deepest vertical pocket in each quadrant.[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269), [7](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr7-8756479316687269) The measurements are then added to give an estimated total AFV. To obtain an accurate AFI, sonographers must follow several guidelines. The ultrasound transducer should always be oriented perpendicular to the patient’s coronal plane, and the deepest, unobstructed pocket of amniotic fluid should be identified.[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269) Gray areas on the screen should be avoided when obtaining a measurement, as amniotic fluid is generally near the black end of the gray scale.[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269) Measuring narrow spaces between fetal structures and the uterus should also be avoided.[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269) A quadrant cannot be measured if one must measure through fetal parts or through a loop of umbilical cord.[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269) The use of color Doppler can ensure that parts of the umbilical cord are not included in the measurement. Each pocket should measure at least 2 × 1 cm to be used in the total AFI.[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269) The AFI is typically measured after 25 weeks of gestation. A normal AFI measures greater than 5 cm and less than 24 cm.[8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr8-8756479316687269) Oligohydramnios is diagnosed if the AFI measures less than or equal to 5 cm, and polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the AFI is greater than 24 cm.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269), [2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269), [8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr8-8756479316687269) The AFI is the most widely used sonographic method for assessing AFV throughout pregnancy.[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269)

The use of the maximum vertical pocket (MVP) technique can be traced back to an article published in 1980 by Manning,[11](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr11-8756479316687269) where he described a normal AFV as fluid evident throughout the uterine cavity, as well as the largest pocket of fluid measuring more than 1 cm in the vertical dimension.[9](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr9-8756479316687269) This definition set the standard for the future of the MVP method. The MVP technique can be used to assess AFV as early as the second trimester. By 1990, the definition of an adequate AFV as a component of the biophysical profile was a pocket of fluid measuring a minimum of 2 cm in the vertical axis and 1 cm horizontally.[9](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr9-8756479316687269) This threshold of a 2 × 1 cm pocket of fluid is the current ultrasound measurement used to estimate a normal AFV when practicing the MVP method.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269), [8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr8-8756479316687269), [9](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr9-8756479316687269) When using the MVP technique, oligohydramnios is diagnosed when the MVP is less than 2 cm, and polyhydramnios is diagnosed when the MVP is greater than or equal to 8 cm.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269), [7](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr7-8756479316687269) A MVP of greater than or equal to 2 cm to less than 8 cm is considered normal.

## Importance of Accurate Amniotic Fluid Assessment

Amniotic fluid volume is ultimately a gauge of fetal health, and there is no clear consensus on the best method to assess amniotic fluid adequacy.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269) Assessing AFV during a sonographic examination, for fetal anatomy and growth, provides physicians with important information with regard to fetoplacental functions as well as the structural integrity of the fetus.[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr2-8756479316687269) In the late second and third trimesters of pregnancy, the sonographic estimation of AFV is an important part of antenatal testing of a fetus at risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome.[10](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr10-8756479316687269) Pregnancies with an amplified risk of adverse endings include those affected by intrauterine growth restriction, uncontrolled gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, obesity, and fetal anomalies and those of mothers with a prior pregnancy with a poor outcome.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269), [9](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr9-8756479316687269), [11](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr11-8756479316687269) It is vital that an accurate assessment is always used in the clinical setting to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality to the fetus.

Proper measurement of amniotic fluid pocket depth, whether using the AFI or MVP technique, requires discipline and consistency if results are to be applied to a clinical situation reliably.[11](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr11-8756479316687269) The precise assessment of AFV by sonography can be influenced by an inexperienced sonographer, fetal position, the probability of a transient change, and the different diagnostic criteria of an abnormal volume.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269) A practitioner should pay meticulous attention to obtaining reproducible, high-resolution images and consider performing at least three replicates of measurements to increase reliability if AFV abnormality is suspected.[11](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr11-8756479316687269) Experienced sonographers become seasoned to subjectively identifying abnormalities with AFV and can greatly influence a physician’s outlook for managing the remainder of a pregnancy. Over the years, many studies have been performed to determine which method, AFI or MVP, is the most defined in determining amniotic fluid abnormalities, since dye-determined techniques are not feasible in day-to-day clinic settings.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269), [8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr8-8756479316687269)

The first attempts to compare AFV and fetal well-being date back to 1984 when Chamberlain et al.[15](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr15-8756479316687269) used the MVP technique to evaluate overall AFV during pregnancy. Using a qualitative scale, they categorized AFV as normal if the MVP was greater than or equal to 2 cm and less than or equal to 8 cm. The AFV was considered marginal if the MVP measured less than 2 cm but greater than or equal to 1 cm and decreased if the pocket was less than 1 cm.[13](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr13-8756479316687269) Chamberlain et al.[15](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr15-8756479316687269) examined 7582 cases and reported perinatal mortality in structurally normal fetuses of 1.97 of 1000 patients with normal AFV, which increased to 109.4 in 1000 and 187.5 in 1000 if AFV was marginal (MVP < 2 cm) or decreased (MVP < 1 cm). The most significant finding from their study was that fetal death risk was increased 10-fold and neonatal death increased by more than 5-fold when the MVP measured less than 1 cm.[14](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr14-8756479316687269), [15](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr15-8756479316687269) The results of this study emphasize the importance of an accurate fluid assessment and how it can affect the outcome of a pregnancy.

A study performed by Moore[16](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr16-8756479316687269) evaluated the ability of the MVP technique compared with the AFI method to detect abnormal AFV in 1168 patients.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) When using the AFI method, 76 women were found to have oligohydramnios compared with only 32 using the MVP technique. Moore concluded that the AFI method was superior to the MVP technique because it identified more women with low AFV.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269), [16](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr16-8756479316687269), [17](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr17-8756479316687269) The limitation to Moore’s study was that the two methods were compared only with each other and not directly with measured or dye-determined AFV.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) Following Moore’s study, Magann et al.[17](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr17-8756479316687269) questioned the findings that the AFI method was superior to the MVP technique in diagnosing abnormal AFV. They then compared the AFI and MVP approaches with dye-determined AFV in 179 singleton pregnancies to conclude if one was superior to the other in detecting AFV abnormalities.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269) Based on their findings, Magann et al.[17](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr17-8756479316687269) found that both techniques were unreliable in the detection of abnormal AFV and that neither technique was superior to the other.[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr1-8756479316687269), [17](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr17-8756479316687269)

The Cochrane Collaboration provides a review of randomized controlled trials involving women with a singleton pregnancy undergoing assessment of AFV as part of antenatal assessment of fetal well-being that compared the AFI technique and MVP measurement.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269) The goal of this review was to determine if either approach was more accurate in diagnosing AFV abnormality to help reduce the risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome. Five trials met the inclusion criteria, which involved reviews of 3226 women between 1997 and 2004.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269) When using the AFI method, it was found that significantly more cases of oligohydramnios, or an AFI of less than 5 cm, were diagnosed, which led to more inductions of labor and cesarean delivery for fetal distress.[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269) Nabhan and Abdelmoula[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr3-8756479316687269) concluded that MVP measurement in the assessment of AFV seems to be a better choice during fetal surveillance. They believe that the AFI method increases the rate of diagnosis of AFV abnormality and the frequency of labor inductions without improvement in peripartum outcomes. The MVP technique and AFI method are equivalent in their prediction of adverse outcomes and AFV abnormalities; however, based on these findings, many clinicians have pushed to abandon the AFI method in antenatal testing because it leads to higher rates of pregnancy interventions without any noticeable benefits.[9](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr9-8756479316687269), [14](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr14-8756479316687269)

## Conclusion

There is no constant standard for measuring AFV across the board. Some clinics use the AFI method and others use the MVP technique. Based on the above evidence, it would seem that the MVP technique is a better choice when evaluating AFV; however, more research is needed. Studies must be performed to determine if that approach will become the uniform standard of care for assessing AFV. According to Magann et al.,[13](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr13-8756479316687269) if either of the two techniques is to be acknowledged as superior to the other, it must meet most, if not all, of the following criteria: The technique must accurately identify the actual AFV (analysis by dye-dilution technique or direct measurement at cesarean delivery) as well as minimize the number of patients it considers to have oligohydramnios or hydramnios. The technique must also be a reliable predictor of adverse perinatal complications, and when used in conjunction with other ancillary tests, it improves neonatal outcomes.[9](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479316687269#bibr9-8756479316687269) The ultimate goal of every pregnancy is to have a healthy fetal outcome. Accurate assessment and diagnosis of AFV abnormalities provides physicians with information necessary to properly manage a pregnancy longitudinally, which may improve the overall outcome of the pregnancy.

## Abstract

**:**

Amniotic Fluid (AF) refers to a protective liquid surrounding the fetus inside the amniotic sac, serving multiple purposes, and hence is a key indicator of fetal health. Determining the AF levels at an early stage helps to ascertain the maturation of lungs and gastrointestinal development, etc. Low AF entails the risk of premature birth, perinatal mortality, and thereby admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, AF level is also a critical factor in determining early deliveries. Hence, AF detection is a vital measurement required during early ultrasound (US), and its automation is essential. The detection of AF is usually a time-consuming process as it is patient specific. Furthermore, its measurement and accuracy are prone to errors as it heavily depends on the sonographer’s experience. However, automating this process by developing robust, precise, and effective methods for detection will be beneficial to the healthcare community. Therefore, in this paper, we utilized transfer learning models in order to classify the AF levels as normal or abnormal using the US images. The dataset used consisted of 166 US images of pregnant women, and initially the dataset was preprocessed before training the model. Five transfer learning models, namely, Xception, Densenet, InceptionResNet, MobileNet, and ResNet, were applied. The results showed that MobileNet achieved an overall accuracy of 0.94. Overall, the proposed study produces an effective result in successfully classifying the AF levels, thereby building automated, effective models reliant on transfer learning in order to aid sonographers in evaluating fetal health.

## 1\. Introduction

Technological advances in the medical field have had a major impact on the treatment of many conditions that were once thought to be incurable or irreversible. Certainly, a fundamental step of any treatment is an adequate and correct diagnosis. Medical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were primitive and could not take into account the numerous medical symptoms before the introduction of contemporary technologies. Fortunately, modern diagnostics have made great advances \[ [1](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B1-BDCC-06-00107)\]. However, it has some limitations. Within the medical field, obstetrics and gynecology is a highly diversified discipline of medicine that includes surgery, prenatal care, gynecological care, oncology, and female preventive medicine \[ [1](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B1-BDCC-06-00107), [2](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B2-BDCC-06-00107)\]. More specifically, this paper deals with prenatal diagnostic procedures, more specifically with the determination of the amniotic fluid level (AF).

AF is a liquid seen in the amniotic sac that envelops the developing fetus in the uterus, serving a variety of roles, and is essential for embryonic development. Although, complications might arise if the volume of AF within the uterus is either too little or too high. Abnormal AF volumes can lead to significant complications including oligohydramnios (inadequate AF level) and polyhydramnios (excess AF level). Oligohydramnios is associated with a higher incidence of stillbirth or miscarriage \[ [3](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B3-BDCC-06-00107)\]. Because the AF serves an important role in the respiratory system growth during the second trimester, it can sometimes result in anomalies including severe lung defects \[ [3](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B3-BDCC-06-00107)\]. It can also cause umbilical cord constriction and other complications. Polyhydramnios is also responsible for other problems throughout pregnancy and childbirth. This condition is known to induce preterm labor spasms, premature birth, trouble breathing, limited air flow to the fetus due to the umbilical cord becoming caught underneath the fetus, and other complications \[ [3](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B3-BDCC-06-00107)\].

The detection of AF is usually a time-consuming process, and it is patient specific. Moreover, its measurement and accuracy are subject to human errors, as it heavily depends on the sonographer’s experience \[ [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B4-BDCC-06-00107)\]. The four-quadrant AF index (AFI) or the single deep vertical pocket (SDP) approach are commonly used to determine the AF volume. Sonographers locate an appropriate AF region and afterwards analyze the depth of the AF region by finding a specific point to measure the AF levels. Traditional AFI assessment is primarily dependent on the sonographer’s abilities and knowledge, regardless of the fact that AFI and SDP techniques are proven to be reproducible and semi-quantitative \[ [5](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B5-BDCC-06-00107)\]. Even after extended training, sonographers struggle to precisely quantify the AF level in the fetus \[ [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B4-BDCC-06-00107)\]. As a result, the entire examination is a time-consuming process that can contribute to erroneous results. However, automating this process by developing robust, precise, and effective methods for detection will be beneficial to the healthcare community.

Nevertheless, though some studies have already been conducted in relation to the AF classification, limited research has been dedicated to classifying AF in US images using transfer learning \[ [1](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B1-BDCC-06-00107)\]. Hence, this study will significantly contribute to automating the detection process, which will benefit physicians as the automated detection helps them to assess fetal health and development as well as perinatal prognosis. Furthermore, accurate detection of AF levels in a quick and efficient manner is very critical. Therefore, utilizing transfer learning to detect AF levels with accurate results and by processing US data will equip gynecologists with a great tool that will help in improving the accuracy and efficiency of their diagnosis and thus will help to monitor fetuses’ health. This paper utilized several transfer learning models such as Xception, DenseNet, InceptionResNet, MobileNet, and ResNet to classify the AF levels as normal or abnormal. The dataset used consisted of 166 US images obtained from King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU) and Elite Clinic in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. The paper makes the following contributions:

- Applying transfer learning models to classify the AF levels as abnormal or normal, using ultrasound images and achieving high predictive performance;

- Develops a predictive model using the real dataset from the hospital in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). As per the authors knowledge, the proposed study is the first study related to the AF classification using the KSA hospital dataset;

- Initially, the preprocessing was applied using various techniques such as cropping, enhancing, and augmenting, etc., to build more robust predictive models;

- Performs cross-validation and provides a comprehensive discussion on the obtained results on classifying the AF levels using the US images.

## 2\. Related Studies

A plethora of studies have been carried out that have focused on using AI methods to detect AF. This section examines the theories and applicable concepts on the subject in the present literature, as well as their findings in order to identify the gap in literature. However, limited studies have focused on the classification on AF using US images/videos. Likewise, Ayu et al. \[ [6](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B6-BDCC-06-00107)\] used machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, rule-based SDP and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, in order to classify the AF into 6 groups: oligohydramnios clear and echogenic, polyhydramnios clear and echogenic, and normal clear and echogenic. The dataset comprised 95 US images acquired from a local hospital. Before SDP feature extraction, the images were cropped and transformed from red–green–blue (RGB) to greyscale during preprocessing phase. After training the classifiers, the accuracy of the model was 0.9052, and was higher than that of previous research. Furthermore, Ayu and Hartati \[ [7](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B7-BDCC-06-00107)\] conducted another study utilizing a pixel-based classification method to distinguish AF areas on US images with noise, distortions, low contrast, and fuzzy margins. The images were classified into four classes including the AF, fetal body, placenta, and uterus. The accuracy obtained using RF was 0.995, using 50 test US images. Finally, Amuthadevi and Subarnan \[ [8](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B8-BDCC-06-00107)\] deployed fuzzy techniques to measure the AF index and the geometric properties of AF at different phases of gestation. The anomalies in head circumference and infant weight, etc., were forecasted using the fuzzy techniques. The AFI was classified as oligohydramnios, borderline, normal, or polyhydramnios. The classification accuracy obtained was 0.925.

On the other hand, various research has employed AI algorithms to segment AF from US images. Following this ideology, a DL model called AF-net was used to segment the AF pockets, developed by Cho et al. \[ [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B4-BDCC-06-00107)\]. The AF-net is a version of U-net, which combines several ideas: dilated convolution, multiscale side-input and side-output layer using 435 US images dataset, and 5-folds cross-validation was employed. For AF segmentation, the suggested model achieved a precision of 0.898 ± 0.111 and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.877 ± 0.086. Similarly, Sun et al. \[ [5](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B5-BDCC-06-00107)\] attempted to estimate the AF volume from US images by segmenting the AF using a dual path DL network, which was composed of AF-net and an auxiliary network. The dataset contains 2380 US images, which were preprocessed using the following methods: resizing, trimming, augmenting, normalizing, and applying 5-fold cross-validation. The model achieved a DSC of 0.8599. Furthermore, Li et al. \[ [9](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B9-BDCC-06-00107)\] also deployed DL in order to segment the AF in the US images. The dataset constituted US videos of 4 patients, where each video length was 20 s. Key frame extraction images were selected; 900 training images and 400 testing images were collected. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.93, by applying 3 inner layers to the kernel in the applied encoder–decoder network.

In another study, Ayu et al. \[ [10](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B10-BDCC-06-00107)\] employed 50 fetal B-Mode US images to carry out AF segmentation. To perform the segmentation, a pixel classification centered on the RF was utilized. For comparison, the images were first brought into two window-size proportions (3 × 3 and 5 × 5). After that, multiple points pertaining to 3 classes—AF, fetal body, and uterus—were labeled by a radiologist expert. The results demonstrated that images with a window size of 5 × 5 reached an accuracy of 0.8586, and images with a window size of 3 × 3 scored an accuracy of 0.8145. Furthermore, Ayu et. al. \[ [11](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B11-BDCC-06-00107)\] also conducted another study where they performed segmentation using pixel classification by applying several classifiers such as decision tree (DT), RF, naive bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The dataset used comprised 55 US images, and the RF classifier gave the best results, attaining a DSC of 0.876 and pixel accuracy of 0.857.

Additionally, Looney et al. \[ [11](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B11-BDCC-06-00107)\] attempted to segment the AF, placenta, and fetus by building a multiclass CNN model. In order to segment the placenta, 2093 images were used, and fully CNN (FCNN) was deployed. The highest DCS of 0.85 was attained after 17,000 training steps for placenta segmentation. For multiclass segmentation, 300 images were employed to combine a two-pathway hybrid model, and a DSC of 0.84 was obtained. Finally, Anquez et al. \[ [12](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B12-BDCC-06-00107)\] investigated the utero-fetal unit (UFU) segmentation by employing 19 3D US images using the fuzzy technique. All these images belonged to the first trimester of the fetal stage. Automating the fetal tissue and AF extraction was their primary goal. An average accuracy of 0.89 was obtained in the study.

Most of the aforementioned studies focused on segmenting the AF from the US images. Some of these studies achieved high DSC. For instance, Ayu et al. \[ [13](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B13-BDCC-06-00107)\] obtained a DSC of 0.876. However, segmenting the AF alone does not help in estimating if the AF level in the fetus is in the normal range. We also need to model techniques that can successfully classify by using the US images, as a normal AF level or not. There was, however, one study that focused on calculating the AF index from the segmented AF. This study was conducted by Cho et al. \[ [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B4-BDCC-06-00107)\] by using US videos, and they achieved an overall precision of 0.898. Furthermore, among the studies that pursued classification, the highest accuracy of 0.995 was obtained by Ayu and Hartati \[ [7](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B7-BDCC-06-00107)\]. However, in this study, they did not focus on classifying the AF levels in the US images. Rather, they focused on classifying the US images into four classes: AF, fetal body, placenta, and uterus. Therefore, in the current study we focused on classifying the US images as having normal AF or abnormal AF. To accomplish this, the US images dataset was collected from a local hospital, and several transfer learning models were deployed to develop a model that could make accurate predictions. Hence, the proposed methods have successfully classified the AF images and thereby aid the sonographers/physicians in determining fetal health.

## 3\. Materials and Methods

This section provides a breakdown of the proposed methodology along with a comprehensive analysis of data preprocessing methods, data-partitioning techniques, classification models applied, and evaluation metrics used. [Figure 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-f001) summarizes the methodology deployed in this study. The dataset was first passed through the preprocessing steps, and then for training, the model and the preprocessed images were split into a training set and test set, with the training set further split into training and validation sets. The transfer learning model was trained and validated by the training and validation sets. After training, the model was evaluated with a test set and the results were collected. The section below contains the details of proposed methodology steps.

#### 3.1. Dataset Description

The US images are classified into two classes based on the AF levels: abnormal AF and normal AF.

Abnormal AF: The abnormal AF corresponds to a patient suffering from oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios conditions. Our focal point of the research is recognizing the US images having these abnormal AF levels.

Normal AF: Normal AF pertains to the patients not suffering from the aforementioned conditions. The normal AF US images of patients are required to enable the classification models to distinguish the abnormal from the normal ones.

Hence, as an initial step to develop the models to classify these AF levels in images, we acquired the US images from King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU) and Elite Clinic in Dammam, KSA. The US device that was used to collect the images was the GE Voluson P6, and we collected a total of 166 US images, among which 100 cases belonged to normal AF levels and 66 cases belonged to abnormal AF levels.

#### 3.2. Preprocessing

The preprocessing involved several steps to prepare the data to be ready for further processing. The following steps were performed during preprocessing

#### 3.2.1. Cropping and Enhancement

The first step after acquiring the images was cropping them in order to remove the textual information in the US images, particularly the top right corner of each image, which contains the patient’s name and gestational age, etc., as well as the scale present on the left bar of each image. This information is removed to preserve the patient’s privacy. The images were cropped using Python. This step removed the textual noise present on the images.

The next step after removing the textual noise was enhancing the US images. Image enhancement is typically carried out in order to improve the quality of the images. The PIL library in Python contains an image enhancement algorithm. Hence, the images were enhanced using the ImageEnhance method from the PIL library.

#### 3.2.2. Augmentation

Augmentation in image processing is carried out in order to expand the size of the dataset by generating new images from the original image dataset. The preprocessing library in TensorFlow contains the ImageDataGenerator class, which can perform the process of augmentation in real time while the model training is performed. This function will perform random rotation, height shift, zooming, and rescaling, etc., thereby making the model more robust by ensuring that it receives new variations of the images at each epoch. An essential thing to be noted is that the ImageDataGenerator only returns the new (transformed) images instead of adding to the original set of images. The reason behind utilizing this in ours is that if the models were to see the original images multiple times, it would end up suffering from the problem of overfitting. Furthermore, the ImageDataGenerator class also helps to save memory by loading all the images at once instead of loading them in batches. Therefore, the process of augmentation was carried out using the ImageDataGenerator class.

#### 3.3. Classification Models

Transfer learning is the process of reusing an already trained model for another task. In this paper we applied several transfer learning models. Below are the five main transfer learning models that we applied, which yielded good results, as will be shown in the results section.

#### 3.3.1. Xception

A unique deep convolution method reliant on depthwise separable convolutions proved to excel the regular Inception V3 regarding the ImageNet dataset, alongside superior performance on a complex classifier dataset involving 350 million images with 17,000 classes \[ [14](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B14-BDCC-06-00107)\]. The term Xception, which means “extreme inception”, thus stems from the fact that the CNNs’ feature maps’ cross-channels and spatial correlations mapping can be completely detached. Due to the depthwise separable convolution layers accompanying the residual connections, the architecture is easily adaptable using high-level libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow-Slim.

#### 3.3.2. Resnet50V2

The winner of the ILSVRC 2015 classification task, residual network (ResNet), was introduced by He K. et al. \[ [15](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B15-BDCC-06-00107)\] to enhance the efficiency of CNN and accelerate the computational time. ResNet can contain thousands of layers without negatively affecting the performance, making it ideal for image recognition, object localization and detection, and even establishing acceptable accuracy for non-vision tasks. Furthermore, the model was proposed to surpass the problem of the vanishing/exploding gradient in DNN by applying shortcut connections—also known as residual blocks—for identity mapping, which does not increase the parameter number nor the computational time. The goal was to stabilize the error rate for the higher neural network layers and diminish the impacts on the lower layers. For example, authors were reformulating the original mapping into M(a): =G(a) + a, where M(a) is the resulted mapping, and a is the input for these layers. This reformulation was considered to add a prerequisite for the degradation problem, which states that an increase in the depth of the network increases the error rate on both training and testing data. ResNet50V2 is one of the ResNet latest versions, with 50 layers deep and batch normalization for each weight layer. The 50th layered model has the same architecture as ResNet34 but adds an extra bottleneck block instead of 2 layers, resulting in achieving higher accuracy than the ResNet34.

#### 3.3.3. DenseNet121

Dense convolutional network (DenseNet) is an architecture that makes deep learning networks much more efficient to train in comparison to the standard convolutional neural network (CNN). In particular, in standard CNN each convolutional layer receives the input from the previous layer. Contrastingly, in DenseNet each layer is connected to all other layers in the network to maximum information flow between the layers. Each layer obtains inputs from all the previous layers and passes on its own feature maps to all the layers after that layer, in order to preserve the feed-forward nature. DenseNet combines the features by concatenating them where the “ith” layer has “i" inputs and consists of feature maps of all its previous convolutional layers. For “L” layers, there are L(L + 1)/2 direct connections rather than just “I” connections as in standard CNN architectures. Thus, it requires fewer parameters as there is no need to learn unimportant feature maps, and results in more compact models and achieves high performances and better results across competitive datasets \[ [16](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B16-BDCC-06-00107)\].

#### 3.3.4. MobileNet

MobileNet is a type of CNN architecture that was mainly designed to be utilized for computer vision in mobile applications. It has been open sourced by Google and can be used for training the classifiers faster. The MobileNet uses the mechanism of depthwise separable convolutions, which entails splitting the computation into two main steps: depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution. The depthwise convolution first applies the same filter to each input channel \[ [17](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B17-BDCC-06-00107)\]. Then, 1 × 1 convolution is applied at the pointwise convolution step in order to combine the outputs from the depthwise convolution step. Therefore, the depthwise separable convolution splits the architecture into two layers, i.e., one for filtering and the other for combining. This separation of layers dramatically reduces the model size and computation. Traditionally, the CNN architecture consists of single 3 × 3 convolution layers, which is followed by batch normalization and ReLu activation. However, MobileNet splits the convolutions into 3 × 3 depthwise convolution, which is followed by 1 × 1 pointwise convolution.

#### 3.3.5. InceptionResnetV2

This is a CNN model pretrained on around a million images from the ImageNet database. Images can be classified into numerous categories, including keyboard, mouse, and pencil, using its 164 layers deep network. With a 299-by-299 image input size, it has a highly exclusive features’ representation capability. The two underlying constituents of the network are the inception structure and residual connection. Degradation and time elongation issues are prevented by the implementation of residual connections \[ [18](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B18-BDCC-06-00107)\].

#### 3.4. Evaluation Metrics

To ensure the reliability and to demonstrate the proposed model’s performance, several evaluation parameters were utilized. Accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC–ROC are some of the commonly used performance metrics to measure performance for similar models. Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations. To calculate an accuracy, first we need to calculate the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative, and then utilize the following equation:

Accuracy=TP+TNTP+FP+TN+FN

where TP is true positive, TN is true negative, FP is false positive, and FN is false negative.

Precision can be calculated by finding the issue of correctly predicted positive observation to the total predicted positive observation, as shown in the following equation:

Precision=TPTP+FP

Moreover, to show how many actual positive cases we would be able to predict in our model, recall will be calculated, which is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observation to all observations and actual class using the following equation:

Recall=TPTP+FN

By calculating precision and recall, F-score, another useful tool, is calculated to evaluate the model performance represented by the weighted average of precision and recall using the following equation:

F-score=2×Recall×PrecisionRecall+Precision

Additionally, balanced accuracy is calculated, which is balance accuracy, and is used in binary and multiclass classification problems to account for the imbalance dataset. It is calculated by the average of recall of each class.

The area under the curve (AUC), which measures the quality of the model predictions and has a scale from zero to one, where the best value is 1 and the worst value is 0, is also calculated. Additionally, AUC–ROC is typically used to measure performance for classification problems. ROC (receiver operating characteristics) is a probability curve, and AUC represents the degree of separability, which explains the model capability of distinguishing between classes.

## 4\. Experimental Setup

The study was implemented using Python programming language (ver. 3.7.12). Several libraries were used for developing the model such as PIL (ver. 8.4.0), TensorFlow (ver. 2), Numpy (ver. 1.22.0), and Matplotlib (ver. 2.2). The experiments were performed on the Google Colab with the GPU setting. The dataset was divided using five-fold cross-validation for training and testing. The training dataset was further divided into training and validation. The model optimization was performed using the Adam optimizer. Five transfer learning models were trained such as MobileNet, InceptionResnetV2, DenseNet121, ResNet50V2, and Xception. The results of each model will be discussed below.

## 5\. Results and Discussion

To assess the performance of the applied models, the results of the test data were compared with the results provided by the gynecologist from a local hospital. Since five-fold cross-validation was applied as it yielded better results when compared with holdout (train–test split), we recorded the performance metric values obtained at each fold. The average of the performance values was taken for each metric for each fold and included the results for each model. These results are included in the respective subsections. Furthermore, the loss and accuracy curve at each epoch was used to monitor and assess the model’s performance.

#### 5.1. MobileNet

The results obtained by the MobileNet model have been summarized in [Table 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-t001) below across each fold. Among all the folds, the highest accuracy was achieved by the first fold. However, most of the performance metrics gave similar values. The mean performance using all the metrics have been included in the last column. It is observed that the model achieved an overall average accuracy of 0.945, which means the model can correctly predict 94.5% of the test cases. Other metrics are also indicated in the last column. [Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-f002) (a and b) shows two plots, i.e., validation data accuracy at each epoch 2(a) and validation loss at each epoch 2(b). From these curves we found that the performance varied at each epoch but remained in the same ranges as the model was learning.

#### 5.2. DenseNet121

[Table 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-t002) below gives the performance results obtained by DenseNet121. In this model, the final fold (fold 5) showed the highest performance. The mean values are added in the last column, and as we can see, the accuracy achieved was 0.927, which is less than that achieved by MobileNet, but the metrics values for both models are comparatively close. [Figure 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-f003) (a & b) shows the validation accuracy (3a) and loss curves (3b) for DensNet121, plotted at each epoch. It was observed that the accuracy gradually kept increasing at every epoch, which indicates that the model was learning well during training. Moreover, the loss increased till the 5th epoch, after which it decreased and stayed in the same range at the end of the epochs.

#### 5.3. InceptionResnetV2

[Table 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-t003) illustrates the performance results obtained by InceptionResnetV2. In this model, the final fold (Fold 5) showed the highest performance. The mean values are added in the last column, and we see that the accuracy achieved was 0.892, which was less than that achieved by both MobileNet and DenseNet121. The validation accuracy and loss curves for InceptionResNetV2 are illustrated in [Figure 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-f004) (a & b), plotted at each epoch. From the figures, it has been found that the accuracy gradually kept increasing at a fluctuating rate at every epoch, indicating that this model too was learning well during training. Moreover, the average loss fluctuated up and downwards between the 5th and 10th epoch, after which it decreased and stayed the same until the end of the run.

#### 5.4. ResNet50V2

The performance results obtained by ResNet50V2 are depicted in [Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-t004). In this model, the final fold (Fold 5) showed the highest performance, and it reached 100% for all the metrics. However, the difference between the metrics values was high at each fold. The model was not consistent in learning. The mean values are added in the last column, and the accuracy achieved was 0.862, which was less than the accuracy achieved by the previous three models discussed. The validation accuracy and loss curves for ResNet50V2 are illustrated in [Figure 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-f005) (a & b). In these curves we see that the accuracy gradually kept increasing from 15th epoch onwards. Moreover, the average loss decreased immediately at the 5th epoch and stayed almost the same until the end of the run.

#### 5.5. Xception

Finally, [Table 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-t005) summarizes the performance results obtained by Xception. In this model, the first fold (Fold 1) showed the highest performance, and the value difference was inconsistent between each fold, meaning sometimes it decreased and sometimes there was an increase. The mean values are added in the last column, and we see that the accuracy achieved was 0.92, which was similar to that achieved by both MobileNet and DenseNet121. The validation accuracy and loss curves for Xception are illustrated in [Figure 6](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#BDCC-06-00107-f006) (a & b). Here, we see that the accuracy gradually kept increasing at a fluctuating rate at every epoch, which indicates that the model was learning well. Furthermore, the average loss moved up and down until the 10th epoch, after which it decreased and stayed in the same range until the end of the run.

Implementing AI techniques in fetal health has proven to exhibit significant results for the diagnosis of major fetus health issues such as premature birth and perinatal mortality \[ [19](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/4/107#B19-BDCC-06-00107)\]. The first process of preprocessing involved the cropping of images for the removal of patient information in the form of text, followed by other noise removal from various locations within the image for clarification. Finally, augmentation was implemented for the expansion of the dataset size using the ImageDataGenerator class available on the TensorFlow library.

With five-fold cross-validation providing better results in comparison to holdout, its performance metric values were recorded at each fold and its average calculated. The MobileNet model’s first fold produced the highest accuracy and best overall performance, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.94, 0.96, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively.

## 6\. Conclusions

The classification of the AF level is a crucial method to diagnose fetus health and development. Early diagnosis of normal AF levels can help in identifying major fetus health issues such as premature birth and perinatal mortality. Moreover, detection of AF is a lengthy process that requires accurate measurements of patients’ US data. This process requires experience to accurately measure the levels and avoid any errors, in order for gynecologists to successfully assess the cases and ensure fetus health. Furthermore, accurate detection of AF levels in a quick and efficient manner is very critical. Therefore, utilizing AI to detect AF levels with accurate results and by processing US data will equip gynecologists with a great tool, which will help in improving the accuracy and efficiency of their diagnosis, and thus to monitor fetuses’ health.

In this paper, we utilized transfer learning models that analyzed US images to detect the AF level. The model was trained and tested using a set of US images obtained from KFHU and Elite Clinic. The models were evaluated using performance measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, balanced accuracy, and AUC-ROC, etc. The proposed models development consisted of two phases: the first phase is preprocessing, and the second phase is classification. In the first phase, starting with the cropping of the images in order to remove the text labels visible on most of them, this process was then followed by the removal of textual noise located in different locations within the images to further clarify the image and remove any noise that might negatively affect the accuracy, then enhancing the image to improve its quality and thus ensuring proper feature detection in the next phase. Lastly came augmentation, which was used to expand the size of the dataset using the ImageDataGenerator class available on the TensorFlow library. The second phase is AF classification, which was conducted using TensorFlow’s five transfer learning models that include Xception, MobileNet, InceptionResnetV2, DenseNet121, and ResNet50V2, which are used to train the model on 50 epochs and used five-fold cross-validation on the data and batch size of 16, in order to accurately classify the AF images to help diagnose normal or abnormal AF levels. Upon analyzing the results, MobileNet gave us the best performance, in which it achieved an accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-scores of 0.94, 0.96, 0.94, and 0.95 respectively.

By developing this model, we aim to help gynecologists and physicians to perform accurate assessments of their cases and thus save the lives of fetuses and avoid premature birth or any other medical complications. For future work, we plan to expand the score to multiclass classification with three classes—normal, polyhydramnios, and oligohydramnios—instead of a binary class classification that includes normal and abnormal, to provide physicians and gynecologists with a more accurate prediction about the AF level diagnosis. Multiclass classification was not implemented in the current study due to the very small number of patients with oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios.
